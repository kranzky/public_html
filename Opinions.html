<H3>Death Threat</H3>

Your homepage really sucks the big one.  If you don't take it off the internet, 
I will kill you.

<H3>Short & Sweet</H3>

You are an idiot!!

<H3>Anthropomorphizer</H3>

Hal cannot spell correctly, nor can he quoke in concise English.
He is therefore a stupid little git, who has no right to take up
valuable space on the net.

<H3>A Compliment Of Sorts</H3>

<H3>Hidden Threat</H3>

I found this megaHAL to be a total and utter waste of time
and no way should it have ever made it on the net as even a
namesake of the original,HAL!!!!!!!!

<H3>Australian Compliment</H3>

JAS IS A SPAZ!!!!!! DEATH TO JAS!!!!!!! DEATH TO JAS !!!!!!!

<H3>Smell-O-Rama</H3>

Your home page stinks.

<H3>Nasty Schoolgirl</H3>

I think all those other peple are really mean and I just wanted to say that your home page is really great (NOT)! It suck majorly and I really think you need a life.  The only reason we are reading your page is because we are at school and are bored out of our brains.  Sorry I can't swear cause there is a teacher in the room. Well I've got more important things to do like (never mind actually,  I'll keep them to myself). Nice talking to ya!  By the way don't put your photo on the page cause it scares people to DEATH!!! See ya! From Tori!  Write back if you feel like it and next time I might use some dirty language to excite you!

<H3>Prograsms</H3>

yuo are uggly nerd.<BR>
your prograsms suck.

<H3>Skin Flint</H3>

Jason You Are A Cock. I am going to hunt you down
and skin your family, I don't like you because you
wasted a lot of my time with this bull shit camera.

<H3>Bad Format</H3>

I cannot help but agree with the other coments, that your homepage is crap.
I take it that you know absolutely nothing aout the novel idea of layout
in web pages, coz yours seems not to have any bloody format

<H3>Spot The Christian</H3>

A bright person like you should be able to communicate using 
vocabulary more interesting and colourful than four letter words.

<H3>Again With The Simpsons</H3>

I came to your site looking for information about The Simpsons.
I have not found any information about The Simpsons on your web 
page.

<H3>Extremely Hurtful</H3>

You are a very bad man.

<H3>Black Square</H3>

I think This page really sucks.  May be it would be
cool if the spy camera of the lab showed the lab and
not that boring black square.  If I wanted to stare
at a black square I would turn off my monitor for a 
few seconds.

<H3>The Winner</H3>

YOU ARE A FLAMMING HOMOSEXUAL PEDOPHILE AND I HOPE YOU DIE OF CANCER. I THINK 
YOU ARE DUMBER THAN SHIT AND YOU BALLS SHOULD BE CUT OFF WITH A FUCKIN' AXE AND PUT IN A JAR SO YOU NEVER HAVE KIDS, EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE NO FUCKIN CHANCE AT 
THAT AT ALL, ALREADY. GO TO HELL YOU GODDAM ASS-BANDIT! I HOPE YOU DIE YOU GAY 
SONOFABITCH!YOU MOTHERFUCKIN' CUM GUZZLIN' QUEER!!!!!! I HOPE YOUR DOG GETS HIT BY A CAR ASS-FUCK!
