<H1><A HREF="/">Jason Hutchens</A>: kenny shrine</H1>

<P>This Web page is devoted to Kenny; a troll who has gained the respect of
almost all of the readers of the aus.tv newsgroup.  Kenny has been sent
from "the God" to teach Australians just how wonderful free-to-air
television is in Hong Kong.  Apart from frequently posting television
schedules, he offers unsolicited advice as to how we can improve our
dismal lives.  This Shrine serves to archive his most sage outpourings.</P>

<P>If you are impressed with the Master's tolerance, feel free to contact
him personally <A HREF="mailto:chowchow75@hotmail.com">by email</A>,
I'm sure he'd love to hear from you!</P>

<H2>Kenny's Koans</H2>

<P>Novice Possum travelled to the Master's hut, to find him watching a
video.  Asked Novice Possum, "Will it make the world a better place if
people in Hong Kong have more advanced video players?".  Master Kenny
considered her sensible question, and eventually spake, "Not a better
place but a better quality in video playback. That's so simple you dumb ass."
Novice Possum shook her head in confusion.  "Did a scientist from Hong
Kong discover penicillin?", she asked.  The Master sprang to his feet,
and danced mockingly as he chanted, "`did did did did'... are you singing
a song?".  As she watched the Master perform the `Chicken Tonight' dance,
Novice Possum became enlightened.</P>
<P>For forty days and forty nights Novice Chacmul travelled across the desert
on his mule, to pay homage to Master Kenny.  They met in a brick house,
where the Master was installing his new PentiumII 266 PC.  Said Novice
Chacmul, "I use a 386... I don't feel the need to get a fake dick."
Master Kenny closed his eyes, and sighed in exasperation.  Finally, he
whispered softly, "your dick is not function anyway."  Novice Chacmul
weighed up the sage words, and was enlightened.</P>
<P>Master Kenny and Novice Fish! sailed across a lake in a magnificent
boat.  Novice Fish! had become perplexed with the Master's ways.  He raised
his flippers is despair, and yelled, "I think perhaps your Father used
to say `Shut the fuck up Kenny' and over time you've misremembered."
Master Kenny pushed Novice Fish! overboard.  As Novice Fish! surfaced,
spluttering in the icy water, the Master spoke, "your mother was fucked by a
shark so you came to this world".  As the Master sailed away, he
added, "Cats eat fishs".  Bobbing in the water, Novice Fish! was enlightened.
<P>Master Kenny and Novice Toastie finished watching Pulp Fiction on the
Master's Sony 16" KV-V16MN2.  Novice Toastie turned to the Master and
complained, "Well, they could have cut it to MA (and leave the FUCKS in)".
Even as he inserted a video cassette of infomercials, Master Kenny
turned and spoke, "You spend hours and hours everyday here just for
complaining that no `Fuck' words on TV? What a fucking, retarded,
dumb country-brother?"  As Novice Toastie considered these words, the
Master added, "You want `fuck', go to sex toy shops then!".  At that moment,
Novice Toastie was enlightened.</P>
<P>Novice Keith read some of the Master's advice, and became angered.
He approached the Master, saying, "I don't think Kenny is really from
asiaonline.net.  My posts in hk.entertainment which were offensive to
Kenny were killed by somebody from netvigator.com!"  The Master listened to
Novice Keith silently, then told him, "Do you have a job?  Are you an
Australian Gay Asian who stay home & waiting for Unemployment
benefit.  Did I embarrase you?  I did nothing wrong, Keith So, you are a
fucking dumb gay Asian."  Novice Keith listened to the Master, and
became enlightened.</P>
<P>Novice Louis, increasingly frustrated with the Master's riddles, approached
him and spoke, "You must be almost unbelievibly stupid".  The Master
sighed, replying, "not me but YOU".  Novice Louis considered these words,
and was enlightened.</P>
<P>Novice Dan was becoming skilled in the ways of the Master.  To test his
progress, he approached the Master and stated, "You sir, are a DICKHEAD."
Master Kenny slowly shook his head with dissapointment before responding
with, "you are fucking dick head..  Go to milk your cow..."  Dejected,
Novice Dan began to walk away.  Suddenly, he was enlightened.</P>

<H2>The Movie Show</H2>

<TABLE>

<TR><TH>The Piano</TH><TD>
I watched the last 40 mins on TV live few months ago, "the lady's finger
get cut off by her boy friend because she had a love affair with a jungle
man!" Finally, she jumped into the sea and kills herself!
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Naked Lunch
</TH><TD>
Shit film. ugly creatures and the visual effect much like "Dick Tracy"
I watched it on TV live but changed channel when the first commercial break
came.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Malice
</TH><TD>
Right now I'm watching "Malice" on TVB-Pearl, anyone ever heard of this
film?? It's scarey but I don't understand.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Leaving Las Vegas
</TH><TD>
It is not entertain because it looks like a documentary or a current affair
program about prositition. It's boring.  If someone told me that there would
be a rape sence in the film then I'm sure I will pay more attention to my
idiotic box.  If a film is lack of plots, a rape sence can really spice it up.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
From Dusk Till Dawn
</TH><TD>
The Chinese young boy in the film is cute and that is. It's a stupid
vampire movie for kids. Blow his head off. Like playing video game! The
girl in the film, what's her name? She also appears in "Cape Fear".
Again, I have to press fast-forward often!
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Consenting Adults
</TH><TD>
I picked up one VHS tape and watch it. It's a movie called "Consenting
Adults" which was taped from TV (not sure when). I fast-forword the first 40
min then found something interesting.. it's about exchanging wives then
murdering. Hmmm... excuse me, how common is such kinky stuff in Australia?
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
French Kiss
</TH><TD>
The
girl who got her pass-port stolen met a French guy. Then that French guy
help her to find her husband who is having an affair with a French lady..
Am I right? I think it's a comedy, but I didn't laugh at all
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Priest
</TH><TD>
How
come the credit at the beginning says "BBC production". BBC is a radio
station from England right? The film is bad because, unlike other movies,
the color was too dull.  BBC needs to upgrade their equipment!
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
The Shawshank Redemption
</TH><TD>
I thought it's a horror movie since the Chinese title "Full
Moon Mid-night Fly Away" sounds like a sci-fiction movie. 
Actually, it's a movie about prison rape. The film was a bit bored and I
missed the first hour and fell for sleep after watching it for 30 mins. A
guy from Ireland told me this film could change my life! Really?
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Pulp Fiction
</TH><TD>
The film is just talk talk talk like a talk show. I didn't think what they
say were funny. "How French people called Big Mac??? Quarter??"
"Fire, Five Fox", "Tomato sauce = catch up = ketchup"????
Very boring. I taped the film and watched it in the next morning with
fast-forward key press a lot!!!
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Heavenly Creatures
</TH><TD>
Two lesbians kill one's
mother, the film is presented in an opera style, too much opera music at
background, boring!  the director present the story in a very artistic and
abstract way. There
was one scene about the lesbian & a guy are having sex and the picture
suddenly went to an amuseme park where she was dancing to a stone man. 
piss me off!
</TD></TR>

</TABLE>

<H2>I Love Hong Kong</H2>

<P>I suddenly find that how much I love Hong Kong.<BR>
I feel that I'm really lucky to be borned here.<BR>
Anywhere better than Hong Kong???<BR>
We have MD, DVD, all the latest model, we can even catch up what's hot in
Japan (paralled import).<BR>
So many big shopping malls, nice and beautiful, huge choices of consumer
products and cheap (compare to other countries, ha ha ha)<BR>
People are wealthy*, the city is advance and nice, superior 
transportation:<BR>
Eastern railway (Trains), Western railyway (Trains), Light Railway, MTR
(subway), and the only railway in the world that service the airport!!!</P>
<P>Look at Japan, they actually far worse than us. Expensive living cost, low
income, an apartment is bloody expensive, at least twice the cost as in 
Hong
Kong and Japanese's salaries are only 50% higher than us (My teacher told
me)!!</P>
<P>If Hong Kong is not that good, why those people who has migrated overseas
all coming back**???</P>
<P>Hong Kong is the best, ALWAYS!</P>
<P>*(Note:a doctor in Hong Kong earn HK$60K+ or A$10K+ per month and maximum
income tax is only 15%)<BR>
** (note: I personally think migrants can*** find a good job overseas)<BR>
*** (note: can = cannot)</P>

Jeans
</TH><TD>
My cousin said that it's common to see an Aussie man has his dick been
pushed to the right or left because of his poorly designed jeans (or due
to his big cock?)
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Washing Machines
</TH><TD>
Actually, you can cover your washing machine with a thick coat. Not only for
reducing noise but for good vibration. Sit on it and relax and I'm sure you
will get a good orgasm for an hour. You don't need to buy a Panasonic
massage lounger.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
New Zealanders
</TH><TD>
When I met my Japanese friend in a hostel 2 weeks ago, there was a
back-packer from NewZealand in the same room. That NewZealand man has been
here for nearly 3 months. He worked as a bartender in a night club and
saving money for his trip to South East Asia. He told me that Australians
brag a lot, many of them are ignorant and believe that the 100" big-screen
TV in "Total Recall" is real.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
ABBA
</TH><TD>
I never heard of Ababa (most Hong Kong youth never heard of it, it is an
old rock band from swizieland).
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Madonna
</TH><TD>
"Madoona - The Girlie Show" on Hong Kong Free-to-air TV in December, 1993
while she was stilling having her concerts been held in Australia.  Ever on
Australian TV?
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Mobile Phones
</TH><TD>
I use phone about 15 times a day (below average). My friend gets his phone
rings almost every 10 - 20 mins. The guy behind me got his mobile phone ring
4 times during a 10 min bus journey.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Toastie and Chacmul and Fish!
</TH><TD>
These 3 country-brothers spend at least 3 hours a day here complaining no
"fuck" words can be heard on TV. They are retarded, dumb losers. They don't
have a proper  job so they just sitting in front of their dated,
rotatry-dial old TV sets and waiting for "fuck" words. Australian TV, please
let them hear some "fuck" word or they can't sleep well...
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Telephone Companies
</TH><TD>
Hong Kong Telecom is the only company providing domestic telephone system.
All households in Hong Kong pay HK$68 (A$11.3) per month for unlimited
access. People here use phone a lot. On average, one hong konger use phone
28 times per day. Since early 1991, all telephone exchanges here had been
digitalised, that is "Tone Dialing".
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
University
</TH><TD>
Well, you know, Australia is selling their education to us, you can see
Australian University advertisements on newspapers everyday. Why do they
target at us if they don't like us?
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Volume
</TH><TD>
Well, back to 10 years ago, I had nothng to complain our TV broadcasting.
Until recently, my patient run out. During a TV show (especailly movies),
the conversation is soft but action is loud. It's not as exaggerate as Laser
Disc but do cause annoying, my father often shout to me "TURN DOWN THE
VOLUME!!!"
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
England
</TH><TD>
From the film,
I thought the story background is based on sometime in 19th Century since
so many old buildings around. No, I saw cars! God, how come England is so
fall-behind? Hong Kong was British's colony but we are so advanced!
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Software
</TH><TD>
Do you think that many Australians can afford to pay thousand of dollars for
original software? Well, I can tell you that most of the PC users in Hong
Kong have Office97 as well as other latest software installed. They can try
all kinds of software that you have no chance to do this in your whole life,
you dumb ass.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Sex
</TH><TD>
9 out of 10 Australian male had been to Thailand for cheap sex
(Evidence: Australia has the highest HIV rate in Asia-Pacific region)
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Aussie Ignorance
</TH><TD>
Next time when I see an Australian says "Well, sorry sir, there is no
multi-system VCR in the world. All washing machines in the world are 
noisy."
I really want to point a gun to his/her ass and shoot!
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Women
</TH><TD>
Australian woman are rough, sexually hyper-active and not pretty at all.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Video Games
</TH><TD>
Video games in Australia are extremely dated (except for less professional
American-designed games), very limited choices the price is ridiculous.
A friend of mine who had been to Australia in 1992 told me that all SEGA
Mega-bit video game consoles for sale in Australia were made-in-China while
the version for sale in Hong Kong were made in Japan.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Australian TV
</TH><TD>
Channel 1: Interview with Back Street Boys (not concert, only interview)<BR>
Channel 2: Movie "Romancing the Stone" (5th re-run in last 2 years)<BR>
Channel 7: Cheap drama from USA "The Cheap File"<BR>
Channel 8: Let's talk about politics (the Government Channel)<BR>
Channel 10: US Animation "The Simpsons"<BR>
Channel 19: Cheap comedy "Murphy Brown"
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
DVD
</TH><TD>
No matter how many people says DVDs are great, how high the resolution is.
My first impression was the picture is un-natural. And I believe that
picture of TV braodcasting (in Hong Kong) is better than DVD!
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Western Movies
</TH><TD>
It seems to me that most award winner western films that must be some 
kinds of wired plot + sex + violence + drug abuse.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Drugs
</TH><TD>
9 out of 10 Australian take drugs
(Evidence: most of those foreginers who had been excuted in Asia are
Australian)
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Australia
</TH><TD>
Australia is a refugee camp. nearly all Asians in Asutralia are refugees.
By the way, it's a dumb, undeveloped, non-hi-tech land, I don't want to go
there.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Japan
</TH><TD>
Japanese made better games simply because they invent computers, video
games as well as video and audio system. That's simple... And American make
better Hamburgers :)
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Mr Bean
</TH><TD>
This special program doesn't sound attrctive to me, anyway, I do watch it
for a while.  Hmmmm.... it's a stage performance. Mr Bean played many
roles, a waiter, a church member... I can hear lots of "laughing" (real or
fake?) and I just don't think it's any funny. This program was transmitted
in stereo (English) with Chinese subtitle.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TH>
Neighbours
</TH><TD>
"Neighbour" is a Australian show, right? (my cousin told me that).
It was on TVB-Pearl in 1991 for about 2 months then was stopped due to no
sponsors.

</TABLE>

<H2>Washing Machines</H2>

<P>Many Australians think their washing machines are the best (well, it might
be true in 1960 when Panasonic was not born yet) actually they are the
worst.
Most Australians are using inferior washing machines and they don't realize
that.</P>
<P>Whirlpools washing machines are available in Hong Kong. However, it has to
compete against other Japanese brand washing machines in the market here. I
asked my colleguaes this afternoon if they think Whirlpools is the best
washing machine in Hong Kong. One of my colleguae own one and she said no.
She complained that it takes nearly one hour to finish a washing while most
Japanese brand washing machines take less than 40 min. Whirlpools maybe the
best in Australia because it is the only one available there.</P>
<P>Japanese brand... Panasonic brand is the most popular follow by Hitachi .</P>

<UL>
<LI>Fuzzy Logic computerized control (built-in sensor to monitor washing
process and adjust accordingly, auto detect clothes texture and auto adjust
water-level, speed etc)</LI>
<LI>no spinning pole inside (washing machines in Australia have a spinning
pole inside and it can damage clothes during a washing)</LI>
<LI>low noise (you can listen to your favorite classic while using it in your
living room, a music will be played after your washing is done)</LI>
<LI>Stylish and superior design</LI>
<LI>Made in Japan</LI>
<LI>31 minutes for the whole course (standard course)</LI>
<LI>3.5 times more water-flow cycling, washing powder fully dissolved
instantly.</LI>

<LI>"speed course" available, only takes 20 min for one washing</LI>
