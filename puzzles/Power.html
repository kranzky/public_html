<P>
Which numbers satisfy the following property... the sum of the individual
digits of the number raised to the power of that digit is equal to the
number itself?  For the purpose of this problem, we define 0^0=0.
</P>
<P>
For example, the number 3435 is known to have this property, since
3^3 + 4^4 + 3^3 + 5^5 = 3435.
</P>
<P>
This problem proved rather easy to solve.  We know that no numbers above
10*9^9 (about 4e9) can have this property, simply because the sum will
always be less than the original number.  Therefore we can solve the
problem by brute force, using unsigned 32-bit integers.
</P>
<P>
I wrote such a program, and it took a few hours to execute on our SGI
Onyx computer.  The solution set is { 0, 1, 3435, 438579088 }.

optimized my solution to run in under 15 minutes, and
<A HREF="power_fast.c">his code</A> is also available.  And
now Geoff Bailey, AKA Fred the Wonder Worm, optimized David's program
to run about 8 times faster.  You can
