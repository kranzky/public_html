* Make a floating window an alternative (but then you can't close it, because
  you lose the history and the context: you have to hide/show it instead, or
  store the history on the server, but then you still have the problem of
  session management: need to use cookies instead of forms: perhaps store
  history in cookies)?
* Fix bugs, get it working on IE5 and perhaps IE4
* Make it as functional as possible, including commands to manipulate the
  interface itself
* BUG: we get access denied messages when we don't own the page - either set
  the permissions or make the interface pop up permanently
* BUG: backspace moves back a page, this can be confusing... need to make
  sure text input remains active at all times, even when doing history
  window manipulations
* BUG: when we click on a link, we lose the events => need to re-instantiate
  on page load, but can't seem to detect page load event (maybe check browser
  location whenever the interface hides, or at regular intervals AND when it
  hides)
* BUG: when input box loses focus from interface frame and is then given focus
  by typing a key, we prepend instead of append
* BUG: WebPal should load in the top frame!
* FUTURE: poll server regularly for live updates, possibly displaying news
  flashes and things like that, or leading the conversation (e.g. "Would you
  like me to remember your preferences for next time?)
* FUTURE: save and restore user preferences
* IE5: first keypress doesn't seem to go through to interface
* IE5: interface scrolls on first focus()
