<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: solresol introduction</H1>
<P>My fascination with Solresol began when I recently watched "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind".  My PhD research is focused on Language Processing,
and I found the concept of a musical language interesting.  I wondered
whether Spielberg had made the whole thing up, or whether such a language
existed.</P>

<P>I read all of the reviews on the
<A HREF="http://www.imdb.com/">Internet Movie Database</A>, and I
was surprised to find that none of them mentioned the musical language at all.
Strange, given the part it plays in the movie.</P>

<P>Coincidentally, I picked up the "Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Language" the
day after watching the film, and read a paragraph on an Artificial Language
called <I>Solresol</I> which uses musical notes as elementary symbols.
My fascination had begun.</P>

<P>A web search turned up scant information.  The only web page dedicated to
Solresol didn't exist anymore, and its author, Greg Baker, had changed
jobs.  After a few email exchanges with his former work colleagues, I
tracked Greg down.  Most of the information in these pages is based on
the email he sent me.</P>
