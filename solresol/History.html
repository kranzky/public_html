<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: solresol history</H1>
<P>Solresol, or "Langue Musicale Universelle", was invented at the beginning
of the 19th century by Jean Francois Sudre (1787-1864), a music master who
realized that the seven-note diatonic scale could provide elemental symbols
for a universal language.</P>
<P>The French versions of these seven symbols are <B>do</B>, <B>re</B>, <B>mi</B>, <B>fa</B>,
<B>sol</B>, <B>la</B> and <B>si</B>, although in this document I use
<B>so</B> in preference to <B>sol</B>, and <B>ti</B> instead of <B>si</B>.
So, in truth, Julie Andrews should have sung:-</P>
<P ID="Quotation">
Do, a deer, a female deer<BR>
Re, a drop of golden sun<BR>
Mi, a name I call myself<BR>
Fa, a long long way to run<BR>
Sol, the closest star to Earth<BR>
La, the note that follows sol<BR>
Si, the Italian word for "yes"<BR>
Which brings us back to Do!
</P>
<P>The words in Solresol are short melodies.  I'll represent words as a
sequence of characters taken from the set {D, R, M, F, S, L, T}.  For
example, the word <B>solresol</B> will be written as <B>SRS</B>, which
corresponds to the three notes <B>so</B>, <B>re</B> and <B>so</B>.  The
word itself translates as "language".</P>
<P>Solresol may be spoken, sung, whistled or played on a musical instrument.
It may be written compactly, simply by representing each symbol by its
first letter.  It may be signed, which is reminiscent of "Close Encounters"
yet again; it may even be represented with the seven colours of the rainbow.</P>
<P>As with all <I>a priori</I> languages (languages which use an invented set
of elements which stand for basic concepts and are grouped into supposedly
universal logical classifications, based on scientific and philosophical
issues), Solresol is difficult to learn.  Even so, it became very popular in
the mid-19th century, and won several prizes.</P>
<P>It was so popular, in fact, that the French army toyed with the idea of
using Solresol as the official means of communication when on the
battlefield.  This is presumably due to the fact that pure tones may be
broadcast over further distances than articulated speech, and the confusion
it would cause the enemy!</P>
