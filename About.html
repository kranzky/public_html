<H1><A HREF="/">Jason Hutchens</A>: about me</H1>
<P>My name is Jason Hutchens and I was born in Fremantle, Western Australia,
on the 22nd of January 1972.  I have two brothers, Darren and Brendan, and
a niece named Lily.  My parents are Barbara and Glen.</P>
<P>When I was young, I lived at 11 Davies Crescent, Kardinya.  I attended
Kardinya Primary School from 1978 to 1984.  One thing I can remember from that
time is "duck and cover" practice.  NASA's SkyLab space station re-entered the
atmosphere and bits of it fell all over my state, but fortunately way to the
south, far away from Perth, the capital city.  If you wonder how a space
station could fall onto my state and not hurt anyone, it's because Western
Australia covers an area of one million square miles (four times the size
of Texas), yet has a population of under two million people (one tenth the
population of Texas), most of whom live in Perth, the capital city.  Perth is
the most isolated city in the world, and is closer to Singapore than it is to
Sydney.  If you're from the United States, know that Sydney is NOT the capital
of Australia---Canberra is.  Perth may be likened to San Diego without all the
bad bits.</P>
<P>From 1985 to 1989 I attended North Lake Senior High School, where my
education was stifled completely.  Being smart was just not cool.  I barely
scraped through my exams, managing to make it into the Engineering course
at the University of Western Australia, but missing out on the Information
Technology course.  More about that later.</P>
<P>After school I thought I'd take a year off to see what it's like working
in the real world.  During summer I worked for eight weeks in a factory,
manufacturing these special little devices which can remove the tyre off
a wheel rim in seconds.  My boss, who lives opposite my parent's house in
North Lake, demonstrated this product on Quantum, a national science TV show,
by removing the tyre from a Cessna aeroplane.  Basically you screw the
device onto the wheel rim and hit it with a sledgehammer, possibly destroying
it in the process.  They had an order for thousands of the things (from the
Israeli army, I think).  The work was tiring: I woke up early, did physical
work all day, and found I was so knackered in the evening that sleep was the
only option.  After eight weeks I'd saved enough to buy myself an Amiga 500
computer (until then I'd only owned a Commodore 64).  As soon as I got the
Amiga, I left!</P>
<P>In 1990 I worked for the CSIRO, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organisation.  I was with the Rock Mechanics Research Centre.  As
a research assistant, I helped set up tests.  Most of these involved crushing
rocks.  I had a lot of spare time, and spent it working on my computer,
writing silly programs in Basic.  I remember the Gulf War happened while
I was there, and I couldn't help thinking whether the devices I'd manufactured
for removing tyres from wheel rims fitted were somehow involved.</P>
<P>From 1991 to 1994 I was an engineering student at UWA.  I was lucky enough
to get into the IT course which I'd failed to qualify for.  Two people dropped
it after first year, so I got in, along with Danny Goodman.  Danny and myself
teamed up with Bruce Cooper, and entered CIIPS, the Centre for Intelligent
Information Processing Systems, in 1992.  We were interested in Virtual
Reality, and had built ourselves a complete VR system from a bicycle helmet,
two video camera viewfinders, a couple of potentiometers, and two Amiga
computers, one for each eye, synchronised via a serial link.  The heat-sink
for the viewfinders was positioned such that it would burn the user's nose
after five minutes.  Electrocution was also a very real danger.  I completed
honours with CIIPS in 1994, along with Danny, Bruce and Paul Williams.  We
never worked so hard, before or since.</P>
<P>Bruce, Paul and myself continued with CIIPS as PhD students, while Danny
moved to Israel, where he married and begat.  We all had a lot of fun following
various hobbies and generally avoiding our research and supervisor.  Incredibly
we learned a hell of a lot during this time: I wrote a few natural language
conversation simulators which became fairly well known and won me a few
prizes and jobs.  At the end of 1999 I submitted my PhD thesis, which was
returned six months later requiring heavy modification.  The story continues.</P>
<P>In mid-1999 Paul and myself worked as contract web programmers as a result
of an interesting project falling into our laps.  We later decided to team
up with Bruce, Daniel Harvey, Sonny Tham and Adrian Yau to form Amristar.</P>
<P>In December 1999, after submitting my doomed PhD thesis, I headed for London
where I joined my wonderful girlfriend D., who had been living and working there
for the previous six months.  I managed to get a job in the computer games
industry, and, apart from being extremely fun, it provided a disposable income
to fund our extravagent lifestyle.</P>
<P>While in London I was offered a job as Chief Scientist with an Israeli
company whose quest is to develop true Artificial Intelligence.  So now I
find myself in a rather science fiction setting.  It's interesting and
strange.</P>
