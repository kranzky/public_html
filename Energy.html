<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: Energy</H1>
<P>Energy is the working title of a game which I'm currently in the early
stages of designing.  At the moment the concept of the game is fuzzy: it still
has to be fleshed out, and I'm not sure right now which ideas are keepers,
which will have to go, and whether there's any other ideas which would be
cool but which I haven't thought of yet.</P>
