<PRE>
Don't be burdened by regrets
Or make your failings an obsession
Or become embittered, or posessed by ruined hopes
Remember when you take yourself for granted
Feel rejected and unwanted
No, you're never just a hat
You're never only just a hat, you know
Hovering sombrero
Hovering sombrero

<P>Hi.  My name is Jason Hutchens, and this is my web page.  If you're wondering
what I look like, that's a picture of your's truly to the left there, taken a
few years ago in a hotel room prior to a Guinness Ball, while in a contemplative
mood (no doubt contemplating all the pints I'd imbibe).  I've been writing web
pages since 1994 (in fact, I was partly responsible for the first web-cam to
go online in the Southern Hemisphere).  This is my second home page, and
contains most of the stuff I rescued from my previous home page, albeit
slightly rearranged.</P>
<P>In the light of this evidence, you
might be wondering why my pages look so drab?  The simple answer is that I've
gone through the Great Web Disillusionment.  So you won't find any
fancy-shmancy Java, DHTML or PHP (well, maybe a little bit) on this site,
nor will you find high-bandwidth stuff, apart from a few images here and there.
I thought I'd try writing an old-fashioned (i.e. circa-1994) home page,
containing <I>real</I> content.  By which I mean <I>words</I>.  Lots of them.
I like to write, and I expect you to read what I've written.  It's actually
a very efficient way of getting ideas out of my head and into yours: people
have been doing it for thousands of years.  If you feel you're not up to the
task (i.e. reading), or if you feel that a page's form and content are
inseperable, and the drab appearance of my page means that it therefore
must contain nothing worthwhile of your attention, you are quite welcome to
return from whence your came.  I'm not stopping you.  Why would I?</P>
<P>For those of you who have read this far, congratulations, and welcome.
You find yourself on my main index page.  The table immediately below where
your eyes are currently fixated contains a list of the various parts of my
site along with an executive summary of what you'll find there once you
click through.  Navigation shouldn't prove difficult, there's not a lot of
confusing visual stuff going on.  Enjoy yourselves, and feel free to get in
touch.  Thanks for dropping by!</P>
<P>PLEASE NOTE that this is a mirror of my
<A HREF="http://www.amristar.com.au/~hutch/">real home page</A>, which exists
on Amristar's web server in Australia.  This version is bleeding-edge, in the
sense that I try new things out here first before transferring them down
under.  I also maintain <A HREF="../">Jason's Ai Home Page</A>, which contains
links to all the stuff I've written, as well as a few online demos (including
WebBot).</P>
