Dear Floyd,

Nail your cat to the floor by driving a big nail through the
tip of its tail.  This will prevent it from running away while
allowing it to walk around in circles for a bit of exercise.

Dear Lard,

Take my advice and scratch up on your language
skills. That letter of yours really is apallingly written.  Honestly,
what do they teach you kiddies in school these days?  Perhaps if you
learn to write properly you will be able to communicate with "everyone
in your house" better, too.

Of course, if English is your second language then forget everything
that I just said.

Dear Bertha,
<BR>
I dated a guy for five years and broke it off two years ago.  Since that time I have dated quite a few guys but I seem to have the worst luck.  I am very outgoing and consider myself to be a very nice person but I always seem to have guys cheat or be complete assholes to me.  
I have liked this one guy for a year he is approximately ten years older than me (I'm 22).  I called him in October 1995 (nervous as hell) and asked him out for a drink.  He agreed to go but he had to check his schedule for the week and get back to me.  He called me back a few days later and said that he was flattered that I had called but that it was bad timing.  Recently I have started a new job where he works as well, but in another department.  We have been haning out and I have found myself attending 
his ball games and going out for drinks afterwards.  A few weeks ago we were talking and he asked me what I was doing for the weekend.  I told him that I was going to be out of town at a bar.  He proceeded to tell me that he too was going to be in the same town I was going to.  I asked him to come and he did.  I couldn't believe it.  We spent the entire evening together talking, dancing, and we sat out on the pier.  When we left, in separate vehicles, he told me that he had a really nice time and kissed me
 on the cheek.  I was shocked!!  I want to ask him out but I am afraid of his turning me down for the second time.  I have never asked any guy out except for him.  What do you think?
<BR>
Nibby.
<P>
<I>
Dear Nibby,
<BR>
I think that you have mistaken me for someone who cares, alright?  I don't
give two hoots about your stupid personal problems!  If you're so desparate
for advice that you'd ask a fictional character halfway around the
world for help, I would seriously reconsider your position as a sane
individual.  Now, why don't you bugger off and leave me alone?

Dear Bertha,
<BR>
You sure do have a problem.  That's the worst German accent I've ever seen!
You're not an unemployed American actor by any chance, are you?  I suggest
you follow my advice: Pronounce your w's as v's, and pepper your speech
with such expressions as "Shnell, shnell", "Auf wiedershene", "Achtung" and
so on.  The
results of doing this can be seen in the very authentic German accents of the
villians in the movie "Die Hard".

Dear Greystoke,

You sure do have a stupid nickname.  However, it's not half as bad as
"You Stupid Git",
which I am going to get your friends to call you from now on.  "Hello, You
Stupid Git", they'll say.  Someone may ask your nickname at a party, in which
case you should be prepared for a short stay in hospital.

people like you nagging me all the time.  Gee, I don't know why I bother!

do you realise that your name is onomatapoic?  When I pronounce it out loud,

Every time I go up in my little jet plane, I see this strange 
glowing ball off of my starboard side. Now, this may not seem
like a particularly odd nor troublesome phenomenom, but 
moments later I find myself lying on the cabin floor with
my trousers down and my face in a puddle of my own vomit. As
you could imagine, it's a little distracting. What should
I do?
<BR>
Captain K.Q.Yokum III.
<P>
<I>
Dear Captain K.Q.Yokum III,
<BR>
The little glowing ball is your friend - listen to the ball!  Respect
the ball!  Do what the ball commands!  You are lucky to have the ball.
Don't worry about waking up on the floor in a pile of your own vomit -
that is a problem quite unrelated to the ball.  In fact, it's got to do
with your serious drinking problem.  Keep flying them jetplanes!

I am hung up between 2 lovely ladies. I am 68 and still have
fire down below, but the fire is flickering a bit. I am 
having a Dr. Dick looking at it and he seems to have fanned
a bit. My problem is that lady # 1 has cooled down, but
we have been going together 4 years and we have become 
attached to each other. But lady # 2 is hotter than a 3 
dollar pistol and we are ripe to get off together. 
Which one should I choose?

Stadlin.
<P>
<I>
Dear Stadlin,
<BR>
Choose lady #2.  You are 68 after all, so get your rocks off while
you still can.  There is no point in developing a meaningful, loving
relationship when you are going to be dead soon, is there?  Much better
to go out with a bang!

Dear Bertha,

Okay. This is a bit complicated. One day I heard these voices in
my head. I couldn't get rid of them, it was quite horrible. I
decided to do what they were telling me, which was to climb up a
really tall building and moon a couple people. I ended up mooning
more people I expected.
To make a long substory short, I was admitted to a mental hospital.
After a number of humourous mishaps, I escaped by sexually
bribing my guard. Now I'm free, and haven't been caught yet while
doing the things those voices tell me to do. Still, I'm worried about
what may happen if this all continues.
My questions are: How can I get rid of the voices?
						And, do you think I can get a job?

Dear Space Cowboy,

Rumour has it that Steven Hawking has a "Fart Simulator" attached to his

designed the simulator, as it would suit your situation ideally.
<BR>
The "Trouser Cough 2000" has four surround-sound speakers to broadcast the
simulated Bottom Burp, an "OdourMaker" to release disgusting smells, and
even tactile feedback (so that you can *feel* them farts).  It is just
what you need to inject a bit of humour into long, boring, scientific
presentations.
