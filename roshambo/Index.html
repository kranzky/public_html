<H1><A HREF="../">Jason Hutchens</A>: roshambo</H1>
<P>MegaHAL, named in honour of
<A HREF="../megahal/">a conversation simulator of mine</A>, was my entry
into the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsbpc.html">First International
RoShamBo Programming Competition</A>, which was conducted by Darse Billings.
MegaHAL came third in the competition, behind the excellent
<A HREF="http://ofb.net/~egnor/iocaine.html">Iocaine Powder</A> of Dan
Egnor, and Phasenbott by Jakob Mandelson.
This web page is a brief attempt to explain how the MegaHAL
algorithm works.</P>
<H2>Source Code</H2>
<P>Please feel free to download the source code to the MegaHAL algorithm.
To compile it with Darse's tournament program (available from
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~darse/rsbpc.html">the competition home
page</A>), I recommend that you modify the tournament program by adding
an external declaration to the halbot() function, and then linking the
code as follows:<XMP>gcc -o roshambo roshambo.c megahal.c</XMP></P>
<P>I have also written a simple program which allows a human being to play
against a RoShamBo algorithm.  You may compile that as follows:
<XMP>gcc -o shell shell.c megahallc -lcurses</XMP></P>

<H2>Prediction</H2>
<P>My opinion, as I have stated on the <TT>comp.ai.games</TT> newsgroup
often enough, is that Darse's competition provides an ideal test-bed for
predictive algorithms, or <I>predictors</I>.  I have worked with predictors
for the last five years, applying them to various syntactic pattern
recognition problems, speech recognition, text generation and data
compression.</P>
<P>A predictor is an algorithm which is able to predict the next symbol in
a sequence of symbols as a probability distribution over the alphabet of
symbols.  The only information available to the predictor is the history of
symbols seen so far.  In order to turn a predictor into a RoShamBo algorithm,
we need to decide what the history of symbols should be, and how to turn
a prediction into a RoShamBo move.</P>
<DL>
<DT>Determining the history</DT><DD>Because we are trying to predict
our opponent's next move, and because our opponent may be using our previous
moves to decide what they're going to do, it seems reasonable to make the
symbol sequence an interlacing of both our histories:
x<SUB>1</SUB>,y<SUB>1</SUB>,x<SUB>2</SUB>,y<SUB>2</SUB>,...,
x<SUB>n-1</SUB>,y<SUB>n-1</SUB>, where x represents our opponent's move,
y represents our move, and our job is to predict the value of x<SUB>n</SUB>
in order to determine what y<SUB>n</SUB> should be.</LI></DD>
<DT>Choosing our move</DT><DD>Once we have a prediction for y<SUB>n</SUB>
in the form of a probability distribution over
all possible moves, we need to decide what our move is going to be.  We do
this by choosing the move which maximises the expected value of our score.
For example, imagine that the prediction gives P(rock)=0.45, P(paper)=0.15,
P(scissors)=0.40.  The maximum likelihood move (paper) gives an expected
score of 1*0.45-1*0.40=0.05, while the defensive move of rock gives an
expected score of 1*0.40-1*0.15=0.25, and is therefore chosen.</DD>
</DL>
<P>With these two modifications, any predictor may play RoShamBo!</P>
<H2>The MegaHAL Predictor</H2>
<P>MegaHAL is a very simple "infinite-order" Markov model.  It stores
frequency information about the moves the opponent has made in the past
for all possible contexts (from a context of no symbols at all right up
to a context of the entire history).  In practise, the context is limited
to forty-two symbols so that the algorithm satisfies the time constraint of
playing one game every millisecond on average.</P>
<P>MegaHAL stores this information in a ternary trie.  Each context is
represented as a node in this trie.  Every time MegaHAL is asked to make
a move, many of these nodes may activate, and each of them is capable of
providing us with a prediction about what's coming next.  We need to select
one of them.  We do this by storing in each node the average score that
that node would have if it had been used exclusively in the past.  We
select the node which has the highest average score.  If more than one
node qualifies, we choose the one which takes the longest context into
account.</P>
<P>In some situations, no nodes will be selected.  In this situation,
we make a move at random.</P>
<P>MegaHAL also gathers statistics over a sliding window, which means that
it "forgets" about events which occurred a long time ago.  This process
allows MegaHAL to adapt more rapidly to changes in its opponents strategy.
In the competition version, a sliding window of four hundred symbols
was used (a match consists of two thousand symbols).</P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>I hope that brief explanation of the MegaHAL strategy has been
enlightening.  I apologise for any omissions or poor English, and blame
that on the fact that it was written at 12:45pm on a Saturday night, following
a night out with friends!</P>
