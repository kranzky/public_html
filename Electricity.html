<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: electricity kills</H1>

Over the last two weeks, one particular thread on the aus.tv newsgroup has
grown out of control.  I'm sure all regular lurkers know what I'm on about.
For the benefit of those who couldn't be bothered reading every article in
the thread, here's a summary of what happened.  All events are in
chronological order:
<P>
On the 17th of April, 1998, Steve (shogan@hello.net.au) posted a rather
innocuous message to aus.tv.  His mum had told him that a man was killed on
the live television show "Reg Lindsay's Country And Western Hour" when
someone threw a bucket of water over him while he was using a microphone
during a comedy skit.  Fish! (abc@123.net) responded by asking whether
microphones generate enough amps to kill someone.
<P>
David (zzdmcana@fox.uq.net.au) replied with a detailed post, which
unfortunately began with the rather ambiguous claim that "it is not the
amps which flow through the cord which is the problem, it is the voltage
that you measure across the microphone plug that is the problem".
Thorfinn (thorfinn@unico.com.au) dared to question David's explanation, and
he began his reply by using the ever provocative word "Bzzt" which, apart
from being a nice (if unintentional) pun, seemed to offend David greatly.
Thorfinn continued by stating that "current (amperage) kills, not voltage".
<P>
David responded by clarifying his answer, explaining that although current
is the killer, it is the current flowing through the person, and not that
flowing through the microphone, which is the true culprit.  At this point,
Tim (tmchm1@mugca.cc.monash.edu.au) intervened, suggesting that the thread
migrate to alt.tastless (presumably because he thought a discussion about
how electricity kills was in poor taste).
<P>
David justified the thread by explaining that he was defending himself
"against a patronising and unwarranted attack", claiming that Thorfinn
portrayed him as an idiot, and possibly deliberately misinterpreted his
original message.  Was it all to do with the "Bzzt"?  Had there been
private email correspondence?  Or were David and Thorfinn at war before
the thread even began?  One must wonder, because there is no evidence that
Thorfinn had said anything personally offensive (at least compared to the
average Usenet post).
<P>
Tim replied with a perplexing message: "But guess what? Your name is now in
the hands of the SQUICKMASTERS!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA!"
I have searched the Web for information on "SQUICKMASTERS" to no avail.
Andrew (ajohnson@chemistry.adelaide.edu.au) continued the technical
discussion, while zaphy (toddmc@nospam.com.au) wanted to know whether it
was safe for him to stick a 9V battery on his tongue for a "tinkle".  Yours
truly (hutch@ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au) followed up with an anecdote of his own
youthful experiments with batteries.
<P>
Daniel (immortal@webaxs.net.remove) suggested sci.electronic.dweebfactor
would be a better newsgroup for the thread to migrate to, while Thorfinn
and David continued their debate.  Robin (merlinc@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au)
chipped in at this point, suggesting an experiment  whereby David would be
zapped with a few amps, and Thorfinn by lots of volts, the survivor being
declared the winner.  In true aus.tv fashion, Robin was having a bit of fun
prolonging the thread by throwing stones from the sidelines.
<P>
Huey (avman@comcen.com.au) piped in with a comment that "30 microamps will
stop the human heart", and Eben (ebenlevy@klever.net.au) quickly pointed
out that it will also restart the heart.  zaphy had a bit of fun with this,
implying that you should always try to get zapped an even number of times.
<P>
Around this time, Thorfinn posted an article which began with the line
"Someone that's done physics more recently should pipe up here".  David
claimed this was an attempt to "undermine my knowledge with patronising
comments and sarcasm".  David stated his own qualifications in detail, and
demanded that Thorfinn do the same.  si (si@bizarro.inc) waltzed in to
point out that David didn't state his argument clearly in lay terms in the
first place.
<P>
David also complained that Robin missed the point by proposing his little
experiment.  Steven (sturtle@ozemail.com.au) moved in to argue that Robin
was being sarcastic, and was "lightening up a thread that had become far
too misled by its own 'importance'".  David agreed that he was sick of the
thread, and suggested that it was Thorfinn who was prolonging it.  Steve
felt obliged to mention that David was partially to blame, by responding
rapidly to each of Thorfinn's posts.  David responded by stating that he
was maintaining his reputation, and that he felt like a hunted animal.
<P>
At about this point, Tim returned, claiming that David had written to his
University to complain about his post.  This caught everyone by surprise,
since Tim's two posts were fairly harmless.  David defended his actions by
stating that he never received a thank-you email when he sent Tim the words
to the extended mix of the Rimmer Munchkin Song.  Just as everyone was
recovering from extended bouts of hysterical laughter, Robin returned onto
the scene.  He expressed in very strong language his displeasure of having
David attempt to cancel his account.   No doubt everyone was wondering
what Robin forgot to thank David for!  Thorfinn then revealed that David
tried to get his account suspended too, but this came as no surprise.
David justified his actions by saying that Thorfinn hadn't yet posted his
qualifications, and was probably spouting rubbish the whole time.
<P>
In a rather large nutshell, that's what's been happening on aus.tv the
last two weeks.  Stay tuned for more in the continuing saga which is
the "Man Killed on Live TV" thread!  Will Robin need to continue posting
from an Internet cafe?  Will Thorfinn post his qualifications?  Will Tim
explain what a "squick" is?  Will David get off his high horse and stop
trying to cancel people's accounts?  Will Toastie ever return from the
USA?  How long is a piece of string?  And where the hell is Possum Bits?
