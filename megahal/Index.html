<P>MegaHAL is a "conversation simulator": a computer program which responds
in natural language to what you type.  It is able to "learn" what to say by
observing the things which you write to it, and is therefore not limited to
the English language.  In MegaHAL's hey-day, many hundreds of users talked
to an online version of the program every day.  These days we can only
reminisce about what once was.</P>
