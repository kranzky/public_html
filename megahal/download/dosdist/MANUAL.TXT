1  INTRODUCTION
---------------

Conversation simulators are computer programs which give the appearance of
conversing with a user in natural language.  Such programs are effective
because they exploit the fact that human beings tend to read much more
meaning into what is said than is actually there; we are fooled into reading
structure into chaos, and we interpret non-sequitur as valid conversation.

MegaHAL differs from conversation simulators such as ELIZA in that it uses
a Markov Model to learn how to hold a conversation.  It is possible to
teach MegaHAL to talk about new topics, and in different languages.

This release is version 8.5 of MegaHAL, and is a version of the MegaHAL
program which came second in the 1998 Loebner AI Contest.  The only
differences are that it is slightly mor intuitive to use, and several bugs
have been exterminated.

You may also speak to MegaHAL online by visiting the following Web site:

   http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~hutch/hal/

Two other programs, HeX and SEPO, are available from there.

2  PROGRAM USAGE
----------------

The MegaHAL program looks for certain files in the directory which it
is run from.

Start the program by launching the executable in the standard way.
Folks using PC's may have to launch from Windows, as DOS may not be
able to allocate the neccessary memory.

There may be a delay as the program either loads in the current brain
file, or trains itself on the training corpus.  After this delay, MegaHAL
will greet you, and when it is done you will be presented with this prompt:

> _

You may now converse with MegaHAL as normal.  Try teaching it your name!

2.1  MEGAHAL COMMANDS
---------------------

Simply type "#help" while using the program to display a help message for
all available commands.  A quick summary is below:

#QUIT   : quits the program and saves MegaHAL's brain
#EXIT   : exits the program *without* saving MegaHAL's brain
#SAVE   : saves the current MegaHAL brain
#DELAY  : toggles MegaHAL's typing delay (off by default)
#SPEECH : toggles MegaHAL's speech (off by default)
#VOICES : list available voices for speech
#VOICE  : switches to voice specified
#BRAIN  : change to another MegaHAL personality
#HELP   : displays this message

2.2  SPEECH SYNTHESIS
---------------------

Lucky Macintosh users can use MegaHAL with speech output, thanks to Paul
Baxter.  Simply type "#SPEECH" to toggle the speech output.  The first
time you do this, there may be a delay as the speech library is loaded.
Or something.  I'm no expert on Macintosh's!

MegaHAL will begin by using whichever voice you have set up in your
preferences.  To change to a difference voice, type "#VOICE <voice>".
For example, "#VOICE kathy" will make MegaHAL use the "kathy" voice.
If you would like to see a list of all available voices, type "#VOICES".

2.3  CHANGING PERSONALITIES
---------------------------

To change to another personality on the fly, type "#BRAIN <personality>".
For instance, if you've downloaded the Ferris Beuller personality,
and unzipped the contents of the archive into a directory named ferris,
simply type "#BRAIN ferris" to switch to using that personality.  A
directory must contain a megahal.trn or a megahal.brn file for the
personality switch to be successfull.

To go back to the default personaility (which is the one found in the
current directory), type "#BRAIN" by itself.

When you type "#SAVE", the brain of the current personality will be saved
into the directory of that personaility.  However, the megahal.log and
megahal.txt files will always remain in the directory which you ran
MegaHAL from.

3  HOLDING A CONVERSATION
-------------------------

To talk to the program, type your message after the prompt.  You may
press <ENTER> to allow your message to span several lines.  To send the
message to MegaHAL, you must press <ENTER> twice.  For example:

Hello there!
> Hello.  My name is Jason<ENTER>
> Hutchens.  What is your<ENTER>
> name?<ENTER>
> <ENTER>
My name is none of your business!

To exit the program, type "#quit".  MegaHAL will save its brain to disk
before returning to DOS.  If you want to quit the program without the
MegaHAL brain being saved first, type "#exit".  To save the brain at any
time, type "#save".  The next time you start the program, this brain will
be loaded so you can begin from where you left off.

4  FILES
--------

You will have noticed several files in the MegaHAL directory.  In this
section I'll explain what they all do:

4.1  MEGAHAL.BRN
----------------

This is MegaHAL's brain.  You mustn't modify it, or look at it.  Actually,
the less said about it the better.  If you delete it, MegaHAL will begin
with no brain.  This is the default situation.  When no brain file is
present, MegaHAL will look for a training file...

4.2  MEGAHAL.TRN
----------------

This is the training file.  It contains lots of sentences for MegaHAL to
learn.  Of course, you may delete the training file if you wish to begin
with a clean slate.  The training file will only be read if no brain file
exists.

MegaHAL reads from this file one line at a time, so a sentence must not
contain any <ENTER> characters, or MegaHAL will only learn half the
sentence!

You may put comments anywhere in the file using the "#" character to
identify them.

4.3  MEGAHAL.DIC
----------------

Whenever MegaHAL saves its brain, it also saves a dictionary containing
all the words it knows (note that spaces and punctuation are also
considered words).   This file isn't used by MegaHAL, it is generated
purely for your benefit.

4.4  MEGAHAL.GRT
----------------

MegaHAL generates replies randomly, but it guarantees that they contain
at least one KEYWORD.  This file contains keywords which will be used
whenever MegaHAL is greeting a new JUDGE.  Typically words such as HELLO
will appear in this file, although you may add any words which you wish
MegaHAL to use in a greeting.  As with all files of this nature, you may
specify only one word per line.

4.5  MEGAHAL.BAN
----------------

This file contains a list of words which can never be used as keywords.
For instance, THE is a common word, and it's presence in the input does
not mean it should be in the output.  Therefore it should appear in this
file.

MegaHAL gets keywords from the input.  So, if you type something such as
"what is the weather like?", MegaHAL should base a reply on the word
WEATHER, not the word THE.  It will do this if the words WHAT, IS, THE and
LIKE appear in this file.

4.6  MEGAHAL.SWP
----------------

This file contains pairs of words.  The leftmost word replaced with the
rightmost word when used as a keyword.  For example, if MY appears in the
input, then YOUR will be used as a keyword.  The file has two words per
line, separated by space.  The rightmost words should not appear in the
file MEGAHAL.BAN, or else they won't be used.

4.7  MEGAHAL.AUX
----------------

This file contains auxiliary keywords.  That is, keywords which can only
be used to generate the output if other keywords appear in it as well.
Most of the words in MEGAHAL.SWP are auxiliary keywords.  For instance,
if you type "What is my name", MegaHAL should use "YOUR" and "NAME" as
keywords, where "YOUR" is auxiliary.

Basically, "YOUR" will only appear in the reply if "NAME" appears, but
"NAME" can appear without "YOUR".  Think about it.  It makes sense.

4.8  MEGAHAL.TXT
----------------

This is the transcript file.  It starts with a short copyright message,
and continues with a complete log of your conversations with the program.
Each interaction is timestamped.

4.9  MEGAHAL.LOG
----------------

This file contains all the error messages generated by MegaHAL.  If
something goes wrong, look in here first.

4.10  PAPER.DOC
---------------

This is a plain ASCII version of a paper I presented at a Human-Computer
Communication workshop which was held concurrently with the 1998 Loebner
Contest.  It contains some amusing anecdotal observations of the online
MegaHAL, and may shed some light on the workings of the program if you're
a hacker-type trying to decode the source.

5  TROUBLE-SHOOTING
-------------------

Q: Why does MegaHAL say "I don't know enough to answer you yet!"
A: MegaHAL says this when it was unable to generate a reply.  It was
   probably unable to load the brain file and/or training file, and so
   it has no knowledge of language.  Speak to it for a while.  It should
   start replying soon.

Q: Why does MegaHAL say "I am utterly speechless!"
A: This can occur when MegaHAL has a very tiny brain.  What happens is
   that it generates an empty reply, and so a hardwired sentence is
   displayed.  Again, you should only see it at the beginning of training.

Q: Why does MegaHAL say "I forgot what I was going to say!"
A: This can occur when MegaHAL fails to allocate enough memory for its
   answer.  I will be very surprised indeed if you ever see it.

Q: Why can't I stop the program by breaking it?
A: I trap breaks to avoid silly judge people stopping the program.  To
   exit, just type "#quit" or "#exit" (see the section on commands).

Q: The program died.  What should I do?
A: Tell me about it, especially any error messages you received.  Some
   of these error messages will be in "MEGAHAL.LOG", so send that file
   to me with your bug report.

Q: Hey man, this is freaky!  This program is learning!  Is my computer
   becoming real intelligent, or is there a real person connected to
   this thing?  It's scaring me, man!  This computer is being blasphemous.
   It's possessed by Satan!  Etcetera...
A: You're anthropomorphising.  Go get a dictionary, find out what the word
   means, then make yourself a nice cup of tea and have a quiet lie down.
