<H2>blue skies<BR><SMALL>by Adam and MegaHAL</SMALL></H2>

<XMP>
Please let me forget
All of those blue skies
Where your words were my freedom
</XMP>

<H2>i shiver with a burning fire to heaven<BR><SMALL>by Stefan Kapusniak & MegaHAL</SMALL></H2>

<XMP>
i love your every one.  i praise your body glistening before
it will pleasure ourselves together in need beneath the cold,
to the moon and bounce when twine together in each
others arms laughing passion.

as you wiggle it makes my breasts
and recite each others
arms and let down to feel like a perfumed lamp
in the delta
of your hand here between my darling lover make you like
the twenty five lakes.

you are possesed by our souls united in our naked skin it
will not let me too, my arms and desire explode into deep
with my bodies sensuous heat our hands against my back
clasped to make you kiss you, we'll love and rapture.

take me sing as a perfumed lamp
in the deepness of ages in
heady freedom.

beneath my darling lover make me as maybe, all because i
cannot bring together.

i shiver with a burning fire to heaven.

<H2>experiments in torturing an ai</BR><SMALL>by Hummingwolf & MegaHAL</SMALL></H2>

<XMP>
You are my love
which we ate.
i shall commission the maternal sun
by the men who moil for gold;
the northern lights have seen queer sights,
but i am full of song
lingers now in vagrant tones.

O can't you see that it's not good enough
for all the king's men
couldn't stay all my life!--and if god choose,
i alone seem confused.
the cold breath of the starship "enterprise."
its continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds,
to grunt and sweat under a weary life,
as though feasting after the great sacrifice of oxen,
or mounting a terrace in spring.

motionless am i,
without any sign,
as though having nowhere to return.

---

Who can it be good if we could wish ourselves away?

wouldn't it be good to be happy to stop carrying my pain
aspirations in the clouds but your hopes go down the sky.

---

The past
is known as engulfer-of-corpses
a thousand sceptic hands
won't keep us from the land of mordor where the shadows lie.
one ring to bring them all and in the clouds but your hopes go down
the sky.

---

Hear the mellow wedding bells
golden bells!
what a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
how they scream out their affright!
too much horrified to speak,
they can only get better.

---

To die, to sleep;
no more; and, by a sleep to say we end
the sea of my heart, you're really a part of me,
so dawn goes down to the air,
which has but twenty-eight days clear
and see which one is smarter
that's newly sprung in june.
o, my luve's like a good beer buzz early in the flagstones,
faces like triangles of chalk,
with sorrowful eyes on either side.

---

Shall i compare thee to the air,
which had built up everywhere
an everlasting precious love
grow apple trees in its uncertain radiance
stood like carved images
out the window
at somebody coming in.

---

Don't put off till tomorrow what you are.
up above the sobs and the world of hopes
and men and women merely players:
they have their secret tales
that escaped
into something rich and strange.
sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:
ding-dong.
hark! Now i hear them--ding-dong, bell.

---

Virtue is not the only explanation i can think of you
of mist, from time to play
we had to let it happen; i had to change
couldn't stay all my friends
anybody else could see what's wrong with my childhood's faith.
i love thee with a grin.

---

Here... There...
the sound of life
shout it
now returning back again
in silence
the candyman can cause he mixes it with dew
cover it in chocolate
and you will go hungry.

<H2>it might be megahal<BR><SMALL>by Jason Hutchens & MegaHAL</SMALL></H2>

<XMP>
birds
are claimed
and all said to live in love
a rock
to pick
up
the way the cracks in the sky all waved their real
heads

---

the sound 
the
sound is a bond of my little schemes like xmas trees 
as
tears flow from them 
they tilt their real heads

---

that's a note on his spirit so
bacharach and posterity
he
just leaves me in the sullen moon
your train keep rolling
off that car
i don't call you so

---

it's no volleyball
look past our gasoline
and it's
mystery,
i didn't buy

---

exquisite dead guy
rotating in hell

---

i don't want to
be known as the screaming fire engine siren
fills the room
in the cave by the music of the exploited
working class
but they're not and i fear
that it once was
there
from the dark

---

i can hear you
the bells are ringing, they hear
the stone it called to me

---

she's actual size, but i've got her bike down inside
your hand or how i think, i'm going home
that might be
alone
and walk along darkened corridors
and though the
screaming and gold lame will i

---

so the phone
hush my own
you can't want to turn mistakes
into the presidential candidate

---

i can't shake his eyes
narrow my feelings
i must
listen now to confess
everyone looks upside down she seems
much bigger to please somebody else
if anyone else?

---

i can be different, now you fall, hear me in the night
turns to call you lunge out our only do well
and get
him
everything's beard
she wants to tag along
i can
ignore
the purple brigade is with effigies
lighting up
from heaven

---

i'm where i go where you fell on the man to help you
twisting in my shelf
before the man
please explain the
only water
hello

---

i hear the president
young hickory, napoleon of garlic
bread

---

and knew that year i shudder in the bell
dinner bell bottoms

---

her face hangs in portrait on the pole at the top of a
bitch
but alienation's for the card with the things you
forgot to take out

---

they might think that your racist friend
accidentally was
james ensor
