<H2>Quick Overview</H2>

<P>Jason Hutchens graduated from the University of Western Australia in 1994
with first-class honours in Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering,
majoring in Information Technology.
He is submitted his PhD thesis in Information Technology,
in December 1999.  More information about Jason's
PhD work is
<A HREF="phd/Index.html">available on the Web</A>.

<P>Jason is a skilled programmer, proficient in C, C++ and Java, with
experience writing intelligent information processing systems and artificial
intelligence software.  He has had experience
building large web sites which feature e-commerce, online credit card
transactions, information mining, user registration and privileges, tools
for automatically generating user home pages, and powerful database back-ends
with natural language interfaces.</P>

<P>Since 1996 Jason has entered the annual Loebner Contest in Artificial
Intelligence, winning the contest in 1996, coming runner-up in 1997 and
1998, and placing fourth in 1999.
<A HREF="http://www.loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html">More information is
available</A>.</P>

<P>Jason's 1997 entry to the Loebner Contest was purchased by a German company,
and used to produce an online virtual agent known as eBrain.
<A HREF="http://ebrain.pdv-online.de/eBrainHtml/index2.htm">More information
is available</A>.</P>

<P>In mid-1999 Jason started an Australian company with five friends of his
from university.  The company, Amristar Pty. Ltd., has worked on various
software contracts, including the implementation of an ambitious intelligent
web site for an ISP in Perth, Western Australia, and a demonstration of
an intelligent Web agent for a company in California.  More information about
Amristar is
<A HREF="http://www.amristar.com.au/">available on the web</A>.</P>

<P>In early-2000, Jason worked at Lionhead Studios on the computer game
"Black and White".  Jason's job was to implement the part of the game which
provided the user with challenges to complete.  This entailed designing and
programming a stack-based virtual machine, a programming language allowing
game designers to write challenges, and a compiler to turn these into virtual
machine code.  Jason completed this project in under four months.
Information about Lionhead Studios is
<A HREF="http://www.lionhead.com/">available on the web</A>.</P>

<P>Jason is currently working as Chief Scientist for an Israeli-based company
called Artificial Intelligence.  More information about Artificial Intelligence
is <A HREF="http://www.a-i.com/">available on the web</A>.

<H2>Personal Interests</H2>

<P>I enjoy playing volleyball, squash and tennis, and flying dual-wire
kites.  I frequently go mountain biking in the hills around Perth.</P>

<P>Drinking good ales is a favourite pastime, and I have brewed my own beer
on many occasions at a local microbrewery.  I also enjoy fine wine, and
recently graduated from a short wine appreciation course held by the Western
Australian Wine Industry Association.</P>

<P>I like reading good books, and I am particularly fond of Colleen McCullough's
historical novels of the Romans, and Terry Pratchett's Discworld series.
In my spare time I write myself.</P>

<P>I own a Yamaha electric keyboard, and have been having piano lessons.  I
compose and record music (rather badly) by linking the keyboard to my PC
via MIDI.</P>

<P>I enjoy travelling, and have made two solo around-the-world trips, once
in 1996 and once in 1999.</P>

<P>I like to make home movies of my adventures; I enjoy the process of
filming footage and then editing it down to something which is
watchable by total strangers.</P>
