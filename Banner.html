<H3><BIG>G</BIG>ETTING SUCKED IN BY <BIG>SPAM</BIG>?</H3>

We all agree that SPAM is the way of the future, but sometimes
it is possible to misuse the wonderful advantages offered by SPAM!

<P>
SPAM was invented in the early 1990's by Californian businessmen
as an advertising network which could survive a nuclear attack,
and therefore market home cladding to survivors of the holocaust!

<P>
Unfortunately, some greedy "students" from so called "universities"
took advantage of this SPAM network, and choked it's bandwidth by
sending technical information about their projects to one another.
It is hard to understand their motivation, but many level-headed
individuals have encouraged the students by requesting copies of
their published papers, and this just chokes the SPAM network further!

<P>
People seem to forget that it all began with SPAM.  It was the
brainstorm of the original SPAM pioneers to put their advertising
on the Web!  Some even allow people to put small amounts of
information in-between the advertisements for free!

<P>
For more information about the history of SPAM, and for hints on
avoiding getting sucked in by Web Advertising, send

If you are ending sentences with 20, 30, or even 40 exclamation marks,

Overusing exclamation marks is a sure way to irritate your potential

his "Question Mark Quota" to only three hundred and seventy five per
chapter!  As he himself writes:-

good ol' semi-automatic firearms.  To find out more, send
