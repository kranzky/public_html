<P>In this web site I intend to perform some interactive online experiments.
The idea is that any member of the public can come in and look at the progress
of some experiments, registered users can take part, Ai staff will see even
more than that and administrators will be able to calculate results and so on.
For the time being I will list some of the experiments.<P>
