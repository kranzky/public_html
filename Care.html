<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: constable care</H1>
<P>Back when the Internet still meant anarchy and the freedom to say what you
like, I used to maintain a small web page containing a few choice quotes
from "Constable Care", a fictitious policeman whose sayings apparently
cause children to be good, but which often suggest double entendre.
Examples are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If a cat's what you need, be sure it can't breed!</LI>
<LI>If you laugh when you eat, you'll choke on your meat!</LI>
<LI>Even if your legs are hollow always chew before you swallow!</LI>
<LI>When playing with balls, mind windows in walls!</LI>
<LI>Jumping for joy is a magic feeling, but don't hit your head on the
ceiling!</LI>
</UL>
<P>I used a scanned image of Constable Care, taken from the West Australian
newspaper, on my page, along with a dozen quotes or so.  It wasn't satirical,
like the Constable Care rip-off's which appear in UWA's annual Prosh
newspaper are, but it was kinda funny.</P>
<P>Shortly after I submitted my PhD thesis for examination, and while I was
in London, my entire web site disappeared.  This caused me no little grief:
my thesis contained references to various parts of my web site!  It turned
out that my site was taken off the air, without my permission, purely
because of a complaint (I still don't know what it said) which was sent to
someone at the university (I still don't know whom).  The complaint came
from Dr. Garth Eichhom, who is basically Constable Care's right-hand man.</P>
<P>I think this is an absolutely shocking state of affairs!  If my web page
breached copyright laws, or slandered someone, then I'd be expected to be
notified by lawyers, and I'd take the appropriate action.  But for my
university to take away my freedom of expression purely based on a complaint
is reprehensible.  Shame, shame, shame, University of Western Australia!</P>
<P>And shame on you, Dr. Garth Eichhom, for going above my head.  That's
the most reprehensible thing of all; a cowardly, indecent, shameful act
which is unfortunately typical of people who have been promoted to their
level of incompetence, and find themselves in a position of power which allows
them to get others to do their dirty work for them.  I can only hope that all
the young kids who read Constable Care's wise outpourings grow up to have
more respect for other people than you do.</P>
<P>This all goes to prove the old adage, "never give a manager a search
engine".</P>
