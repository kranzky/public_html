$comment[]="This is the view out of my bedroom window at the Ai Mansion.  As you can see it looks almost nothing at all like the images we all see on CNN.  In fact, the Mansion is situated in an affluent suburb about 20 minutes from Tel Aviv and 15 from the airport (in the opposite direction).  The ride from the airport to the Mansion is safe, and we will put you up in the mansion so that you can keep travel to a minimum if you so desire (we have three guest bedrooms with en suite).";

$comment[]="That's me (on the left) chatting to Oded Nov, who works here on public relations, marketing, the web site and all that jazz.  He's organising a trip of four public relations guys from a large New York advertising agency for the week before you're due to come over.  We're sitting on the steps out the back of the Mansion enjoying a beer at a company barbeque and sundowner."; 

$name[]="The Team";
$photo[]="bunker.jpg";
$comment[]="Here you can see a few of the people in the Ai team (there's about twenty of us altogether) in The Bunker.  The Bunker is an ex-bomb shelter which has been converted to a movie theatre.  We have a projection system with a 15 foot screen, full surround sound, and we're hooked up to DVD, VHS, cable television, a Sega Dreamcast and a PC for web surfing.  So bring those DVD's with you: our movie theatre is amazing!"; 

$name[]="Anat and Netta";
$photo[]="mango.jpg";
$comment[]="We have a lot of fruit trees in our garden, and here you can see Netta (our secretary and all-round nice person who is responsible for making Ai tick) and Anat (the Chief Trainer of the baby computer we're developing in our research department) preparing to gather a boxful of mangoes.  Yum!  That's the Mansion in the background, of course!  Ooops, I should say that Netta is the one carrying the empty box!"; 

$name[]="The Lounge and Bar";
$photo[]="lounge.jpg";
$comment[]="Apart from the Bunker we have several meeting rooms scattered throughout the Mansion, including this rather garish looking lounge area (it looks so much better now, this particular image was captured prior to our restoration efforts).  We also have the Aquarium, a glass room in the middle of the Mansion which contains another projection system, like the one in the Bunker.  We hope to use the Bar for pre-lunch aperitifs in the future (hopefully we'll have this up and running for your visit)."; 

$name[]="Chong Rak";
$photo[]="chongrak.jpg";
$comment[]="Chong Rak is from Thailand, and he's been a part of the Mansion for the past two decades (during which time two different families have lived here).  He's a fantastic cook, and prepares us a different lunch menu every day.  The food is so good, but we feel guilty about eating so well, so some of us attend weekly exercise classes hosted in our gym, swim in the pool, play tennis or basketball on the courts in the back yard, or simply enjoy a weekly massage to make up for all that exercise (courtesy of a masseuse who visits all day on Wednesdays)."; 

$name[]="Lunch Time";
$photo[]="lunch.jpg";
$comment[]="We have since renovated the lunch room a bit to cater for our growing family, but this picture still gives a pretty good impression of what our lunch breaks are like.  During the day everyone may be working on different projects, and sometimes we'd hardly see each other were it not for our lengthy midday repast."; 

$name[]="Yaki and Yuval";
$photo[]="yaki_and_yuval.jpg";
$comment[]="Here you can see Yaki and Yuval.  Yaki, on the right, is the
founder of our company.  He's the man who decided to turn the sci-fi notion of
a computer you can converse with into a reality.  On his left is Yuval, who is
the Vice President.  As you can see, they're both relaxed guys.  Yaki and
Yuval will be introducing you to our company on the day of your arrival,
beginning with a screening of our company documentary (did I tell you we have
a full-time documentary producer working for us... so much to tell)!";
