<H2>Information about the Segmentation Experiment</H2>

The segmentation experiment is all about identifying words from a sample
of text.  This would be easy if the experiment was in English, but it
isn't!  Instead, wthe languages are artificial, and therefore you have no 
idea what a "word" is!

<H2>Rules for the Segmentation Experiment</H2>

You will be shown a sample of text taken from some language.  There will
be no spaces between the words at all.  Your task is to examine this text
for as long as you like, before having a guess at what the words in it are.

<P>
When you decide to have a guess, you will be shown a list of "words".  You
simply have to click on a checkbox next to each word if you think it was in
the language.
