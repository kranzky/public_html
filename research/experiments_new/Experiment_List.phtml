Firstly, the Experiment prize has not yet been awarded, due to time
constraints on my behalf.  I expect to award this prize by the weekend.
Sorry for the delay, folks!
<P>
Secondly, I have currently been developing a website for a local ISP here in
Perth.  They offer free web pages, and make it easy to put forums, downloads,
links and content on your free page.  I'd really appreciate some testers, so,
if you'd like to do me a favour, <A HREF="http://www.netship.net/">head on
over to NetShip</A>.  Your feedback would be deeply appreciated.  Thanks!
<P>
Thirdly, Ill be heading overseas soon... to Hamburg, Dublin and New York
City.  If you live in any of these places, and you'd like to meet up,
why not check out
<A HREF="http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~hutch/travel/">my itinerary</A>,
and then email me to let me know where and when to meet you?

<H2>Category #1: Story Writing</H2>

(please read the <A HREF="Story_Information.phtml">rules and information</A>
for this experiment <I>before</I> you begin)
<P>
These experiments are all to do with collective consciousness.  Your task
is to participate in writing a story with thousands of other people.  You
write one word at a time, and you can only see a few of the previous words
(from 1 through to 15).  There are three genre's of story, which means there
are twenty-four individual experiments.  To qualify for the prize money, you
must add at least one word to each of the stories.
<P>
<?
	if($story<24);
		echo "<B>You have added at least one word to $story of the 24 stories.</B>";
	else;
		echo "<B>You have added at least one word to each of the 24 stories!</B>";
	endif;
>
<P>
In the list below, the number shown in square brackets indicates the number
of words you have added to that particular story.  If the "Add Word" isn't
a hyperlink,
it means that you can't currently add anything to that story, because your
previously added word is still visible.

<H2>Category #2: Prediction</H2>

(please read the <A HREF="Prediction_Information.phtml">rules and
information</A> for this experiment <I>before</I> you begin)
<P>
These experiments are all to do with prediction.  Your task is to predict
which symbol follows a short sequence of symbols.  The symbols may be either
English words, or letters from the alphabet.  To qualify for the prize
money, you must complete each of the <? echo $num_predict; > experiments
in this section.

<UL><LI>
<?
	if($predict<$num_predict);
		echo "<A HREF=\"Prediction.phtml\">Prediction experiment #"+($predict+1)+" of $num_predict (you've done $position of $length symbols)</A>.";
	else;
		echo "<B>You have completed all $num_predict of the prediction experiments!</B>";
	endif;
>
</LI></UL>

<H2>Category #3: Segmentation</H2>

(please read the <A HREF="Segmentation_Information.phtml">rules and
information</A> for this experiment <I>before</I> you begin)
<P>
These experiments are all to do with segmentation.  Your task is to examine
a page of characters carefully.  The characters on the page are from some
sort of a language, but all of the spaces between words have been removed.
Once you have examined the page of characters, you will be asked to choose,
from a list of possibilities, the valid "words" in the language.
To qualify for the prize money, you must complete each of the
<? echo $num_segment; > experiments in this section.

<UL><LI>
<?
	if($segment<$num_segment);
		echo "<A HREF=\"Segmentation.phtml\">Try the next segmentation experiment (#"+($segment+1)+" of $num_segment)</A>.";
	else;
		echo "<B>You have completed all $num_segment of the segmentation experiments!</B>";
	endif;
>
</LI></UL>

<H2>Category #4: Smoothing</H2>

(please read the <A HREF="Smoothing_Information.phtml">rules and
information</A> for this experiment <I>before</I> you begin)
<P>
These experiments are all to do with smoothing.  Your task is to guess which
word should appear in a sentence in order to make it complete.  You will
be presented with a sentence which has one word blanked out, and you need
to guess what the missing word is.
To qualify for the prize money, you must complete each of the
<? echo $num_smooth; > experiments in this section.

<UL><LI>
<?
	if($smooth<$num_smooth);
		echo "<A HREF=\"Smoothing.phtml\">Try the next smoothing experiment (#"+($smooth+1)+" of $num_smooth)</A>.";
	else;
		echo "<B>You have completed all $num_smooth of the smoothing experiments!</B>";
	endif;
>
</LI></UL>

<H2>Feedback</H2>

Feedback and constructive comments are more than welcome!  Please take the
time to fill out the feedback form below whenever you have a comment,
critiscism, suggestion or whatever.  Thanks!  Please note that you

<H2>Thankyou!</H2>

I'll end this page by saying a big THANK-YOU to you for participating in these
experiments.  By doing this, you are helping me to complete my research, and
I am extremely grateful.
