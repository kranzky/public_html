We have been having some problems with our network server here, which means
that the experiments may either be unavailable to you, or results of recent
experiments you performed may have become lost.  Unfortunately, nothing can
be done about this.  You may have to repeat experiments that you've already
done.  This will affect results, but I will take it into account when
analysing the results.  Sorry, folks!  These network problems may persist
for a day or two, but everything should be okay by Monday.

The public version has been online for about two weeks, and there have been
no major problems.  Eighty-six guinea pigs have joined, and many of them
have completed all of the experiments.  Each of the stories contains over
fifty words, the longest has over one hundred words in it.

The public version is now online! I won't have net access for the next 10 days,
because I'll be on holiday. I therefore hope that everything goes smoothly!

The beta-test is over.  I will spend a few days tidying things up before
the final version is announced.

The beta test is halfway through.
