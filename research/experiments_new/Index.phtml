<H2>Information</H2>

As part of my
<A HREF="http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~hutch/research/">PhD research</A>
at the
<A HREF="http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/">Centre for Intelligent Information
Processing Systems</A>, and my side hobby of
<A HREF="http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~hutch/hal/">conversation simulation</A>,
I thought I'd conduct some experiments in natural language.
These experiments were:
<UL>
<LI>A story writing experiment, where participants added a single word to
24 different stories in 3 different genres.  The participants could only
se a few of the previous words (either 1,2,3,4,5,7,10 or 15).</LI>
<LI>A segmentation experiment, where participants were given a sequence
of characters, and had to segment this sequence into "words".</LI>
<LI>A prediction experiment, where participants guessed which word or
symbol came next in a sequence.</LI>
<LI>A smoothing experiment, where participants guessed at the missing word
or symbol in a sequence.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Although these experiments were conducted mostly out of curiosity, they
have raised some interesting issues with regard to computational language
acquisition.
