<H2>Information about the Story Experiment</H2>

These experiments are all to do with collective consciousness.
The idea is to
compare the performance of a biological machine (that's
what this experiment is all about, building a computer from thousands of
human minds, each of which has real-world experience) with that of a simple
computer program.
<P>
The texts produced from these experiments (there will be twenty-four texts
in all) will be used for other purposes, such as approximating the redundancy
of the English language.  They should also be rather amusing, and should make
entertaining reading.
<P>
There are three genres of text which you are required to write.  For each
genre, there are eight individual stories, the difference between them being
the number of previous words shown to you, the author.
Based upon your reading and comprehension of these previous words, you must
type the next word to keep the story grammatical, and to ensure that it
continues to make sense within its genre.
<P>
The three genres are Murder, Romance and Freeform.  The word you add to
the Murder stories should keep the text within the genre of a murder
mystery.  Similarly for the Romance genre.  In the Freeform genre, however,
you may write whatever you wish, as long as the text remains grammatical
and understandable.  Pure nonsense is not permitted, and you will be
disqualified if you violate this requirement.
<P>
As an example of what results we can expect to see from this experiment,
consider this amusing snippet, taken from a similar experiment conducted in
1948 by J.J. Coupling:
<P>

When I killed her I stabbed Paul between his powerful jaws clamped
tightly together.  Screaming loudly despite fatal consequences in the
struggle for life began ebbing as he coughed hollowly spitting blood
from his ears.

<H2>Rules for the Story Experiment</H2>

In this experiment, you will be shown a sequence of words,
and you will be required to provide the next word in the sequence.  Your
choice
is required to keep the sequence of words grammatical, and to ensure that the
flow of the story (based on the sequence of words) makes sense within
the genre.
<P>
For example, you might decide that the word "<B>mat!</B>" should follow the
sequence "<B>The cat sat on the</B>".  Note that punctuation,
an exclamation mark, is present in the word to be added.
This is to ensure that the final sequence, "<B>The cat sat on the mat!</B>"
satisfies the rules of remaining grammatical.  The word "<B>mat</B>" is ending
the sentence in this case, so end of sentence punctuation has to be
included.  Choose
your punctuation carefully, so that the sequence of words flows on well.
<P>
One thing that you don't need to worry about is space.  A space will
automatically be inserted between the last word of your sequence and the
word you entered.  Notice, for instance, that in the example above, a space
has been inserted between "<B>the</B>" and "<B>mat</B>".  The only situation
where you'll need to insert a space into your word is when you want a space
to follow punctuation, such as a comma.  For instance, if you wished to add
the word "<B>, mat!</B>", you'd need to include the space after the comma.
<P>
When you enter a word into the text box and press enter, you will be
shown the sequence that the next
user will see.  Click on "Accept Addition" to go ahead with the
addition of the word.
If the sequence doesn't look as you'd expect it to, go back to the
previous page and make some changes.
<P>
You might like to add words many times (it's kind of fun)!  However, note
that you will not be allowed to add a word if one of your previously added
words is still visible within the sequence.  So, you might have to wait a
while before you can add a second word to the same story.
