<H2>Information about the Prediction Experiment</H2>

The prediction experiment is all to do with how good human beings are at
predicting the future.  You will be shown a sequence of words, letters,
or other symbols, and your job will be to have a guess at what the next
word, letter or symbol should be.
<P>
The only information you have available to you will be the previous
words, letters or symbols in the sequence.  This makes guessing rather
difficult.  This is exactly the problem that is faced when designing a
computer program to compress data, or recognise speech.  You, a human
being, should be able to out-perform such programs, even when you are
hamstrung in exactly the same way.
<P>
Most of the experiments will deal with English text.  However, one or two
of them will deal with artificial languages.

<H2>Rules for the Prediction Experiment</H2>

You may be shown a sequence of words, letters or symbols.  In all cases,
you will be required to guess what the next word, letter or symbol is.

<P>
In the case of words, you can simply type the word into the text box.
Make sure you spell it correctly, since you won't be given an opportunity
to verify your guess before it is submitted.  Press the "Enter" key after
typing the word.  If it is correct, you will be asked to guess the word
after it, and so on, until the end of the sequence.  If it is incorrect,
you will be asked to have another guess.

<P>
After you have had 10 guesses at the word, you will be given the opportunity
to give up.  You don't have to give up if you think that you'll get the word
sooner or later.  The option is only there to stop you from getting too
bored.  Just click the "Give up" button, and you will be told what the word
actually was.  When this happens, you will be asked to gauge your reaction to
this.

<P>
In other experiments, prediction may be done with letters or symbols.  You
may type your guess into the text box, in the same way as the word-based
experiment, or you may make a selection from a pop-up menu.  This menu
only contains the remaining letters or symbols, which you haven't tried as
a guess yet.  In these experiments, you will NOT be given the opportunity to
give up.
