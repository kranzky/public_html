<H2>Introduction</H2>

My name is <A HREF="http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/~hutch/">Jason Hutchens</A>,
and I am doing a PhD on <I>Natural Language Grammatical Inference</I>.
I work in the
<A HREF="http://ciips.ee.uwa.edu.au/">Centre for Intelligent Information
Processing Systems</A>, which is more concisely known as "CIIPS",
in the Department of
<A HREF="http://www.ee.uwa.edu.au/">Electrical & Electronic Engineering</A>
at the
<A HREF="http://www.uwa.edu.au/">University of Western Australia</A>.  In
this section, I introduce the field of <I>Grammatical Inference</I>, I
outline my personal aims in this project, and I get a bit philosophical about
future directions.

<H2>Research Area</H2>

My research is in the field of Grammatical Inference.  Well, the field doesn't
really exists as such, the closest you get is <I>Computational Linguistics</I>.
I am approaching things from an engineer's point of view rather than a
linguist's, so I am more concerned with information theory and rather less
concerned with formal linguistics.  In truth, I am interested in
<I>Language Acquisition</I> and how it works in our heads.  I am not of the
Chomskian persuasion, so I tend to believe that the bits of our brains that
we use to learn and process language are generic information processing
devices, rather than specific language machines.

<H2>Aim</H2>

My original aim was to make a better language model for speech recognition
systems.  I progressed down this path a certain way, but then the field of
<I>Data Compression</I> lured me off-track.  Speech recognition systems and
data compressors both require a statistical language model, but data
compressors place more constraints on the model which makes the problem a lot
more challenging.  Also, the folks in the field of Data Compression seemed
to know little about Grammatical Inference, so I though that I may be able to
make a small impact on their thinking.
<P>
What constraints do data compressors compose?  Well, if you're interested in
compressing generic data you are restricted as follows:
<OL>
<LI>The language model cannot make any assumptions about what data it is
likely to see during the compression process.  This means that the model
must be adaptive, and must start off in a state which favours no particular
kind of data.</LI>
<LI>The model can't even make any assumptions about which sort of symbols
are likely to occur, apart from the global assumption that they'll be made
up of bits (or bytes).</LI>
<LI>The language model must adapt to the data as quickly as possible.</LI>
</OL>
This differs somewhat from the static approach taken in the field of <I>Speech
Recognition</I>, where the language model is constructed from a corpus and
evaluated on a disjoint corpus.  In fact, such a model couldn't be used as
a data compressor unless the model itself was encoded along with the
compressed representation of the data!  Therefore, "real" data compression
offers a performance measure which is in my opinion a more accurate one than
the <I>Perplexity</I> measure used in speech recognition.
<P>
Right now, my aim is to make the best generic data compressor on the planet.
That probably sounds to be quite a big aim, but I believe that it's possible.
It won't be fast (it'll most likely be incredibly slow), but I do hope that
I can out-perform state-of-the-art compression systems by a considerable
amount.

<H2>Philosophical Stuff</H2>

I'm doing a PhD, so I suppose philosophizing isn't out of the question.
