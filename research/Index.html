<P>I have <I>finished</I> writing my
<A HREF="../phd/">PhD thesis</A>; I recommend that you read that in
preference to looking at these pages, which are quite out-dated.</P>

<H2>Abstract</H2>

<CENTER>
<I>
This page contains details about my research.  It's still heavily under
construction at this stage, but that doesn't mean it's not worth having
a look at.  I haven't kept any of my research or experimental results
hidden, I intend to put everything up here.  Consult the contents to read
about what each section contains.  Each section has a short-cut next to the
heading, so you don't need to navigate back through the table of contents
each time.
