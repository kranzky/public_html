<H2>Information about the Smoothing Experiment</H2>

The smoothing experiment is a bit like the old "Blankety-Blanks" game.
You will be shown a sentence which has a word, letter or symbol missing,
and you will be asked to guess what it should be.

<H2>Rules for the Smoothing Experiment</H2>

The rules are identical to those for the prediction experiment.
