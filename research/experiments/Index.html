<H2>Information</H2>

<P>This web site is a resurrected version of some PHP2 server-side scripts
and a mSQL database back-end which I deployed in mid-1998 as part of my
research.  It has been updated to use PHP4 and a MySQL database backend.
It is intended to be a proof-of-concept of the Ai Online Lab.</P>
