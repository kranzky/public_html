<H3><A NAME="1.1">Help!</A></H3>

If you need help, and this FAQ doesn't answer your question, please email
<A HREF="mailto:hutch@tmbg.org">hutch@tmbg.org</A>
and I will do my best to help you.

<H3><A NAME="1.2">What currency is the $100 in?</A></H3>

It is in Australian dollars.  The exchange rate is fairly poor at the time
of writing, but it should still represent a sizeable sum of money not matter
where you're from.   To find out how much money it represents in your
currency, visit the
<A HREF="http://www.xe.net/currency/">Universal Currency
Converter</A>&#153;.

<H3><A NAME="1.3">Can I use the same email and password from home and work?</A></H3>

You sure can!  The email address you entered is equivalent to your user name,
so you can log in from anywhere... even someone elses account!  Just enter
your email address and your password.

<H3><A NAME="1.4">How are YOU getting feedback?</A></H3>

I have developed a lot of online tools to analyse the experimental results,
so I can quickly see how things are going.  When you complete the experiment
and opt to retire from it, you will be given access to a cut-down version
of these tools.

<H3><A NAME="1.5">How will the winner be chosen?</A></H3>

After six months have expired, I'll officially stop the experiment.  Once
this occurs, I will make a list of all people who have completed all of the
experiments, and who have followed all of the rules.  A user will be selected
at random from this list, and declared the winner!

<H2><A NAME="2">Registration</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="2.1">Where's my password?</A></H3>

Your password will be emailed to the email address you specified when
registering.  It is possible that there will be some delay sending this
information to you.  If you haven't received your password within 24
hours, please email
<A HREF="mailto:hutch@tmbg.org">hutch@tmbg.org</A>
and I will do my best to help you.

<H3><A NAME="2.2">Why do I have to be aged 18 or over?</A></H3>

You don't have to anymore.  I got many complaints, and thought it a bit
unfair.  So, from now on, there's no age restriction.

<H3><A NAME="2.3">Why do I get an error when using Lynx?</A></H3>

We're not talking about the male cologne here, either.  Some versions
of the Lynx web browser seem to be incompatible with my experiment
pages.  I don't know what the problem is, so I can't fix it.  I can
only suggest that you try a different version of Lynx, or go over to
the Dark Side and use another web browser.  Sorry!

<H2><A NAME="3">The Story Experiment</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="3.1">Why didn't my word appear in the story?</A></H3>

To add a word to one of the stories, you must type the word into the
text box, and then PRESS ENTER.  You will then be asked to confirm that
you wish to add the word, and you must click the button to do this,
otherwise your word won't be added.
