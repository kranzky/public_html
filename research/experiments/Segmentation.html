Below is a list of "words".  Some of these are words in the language
which was used to write the text you've just seen.  Some of them aren't.
Please select you words which you think ARE in the language by checking
the box next to each word.  Once you are confident that you've selected
all of the words, click on the "Submit Words" box.

Your task in this experiment is to closely examine the text shown below.
This text comes from a language of some sort, but all of the spaces between
words have been removed, so you can't tell where one word ends and the next
begins.  You will be required to select which words you believe are in this
language from a list.
<P>
PLEASE NOTE that, in the text fragment below, the words don't necessarily
end at the end of each line.  Instead, a single word may be split across
multiple lines!
