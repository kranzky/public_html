<H2>Retire from the experiments</H2>

Once you have confirmed that you do want to retire, you will NO LONGER be
permitted to take part in any of the experiments, including the story
writing ones!  However, you WILL be allowed to read each of the 24 stories
in their entirety.  These stories will continue to grow before your eyes
as more and more people add words to them!

<P>
There is also a SPECIAL REWARD as a way of me thanking you for taking part
in these experiments.  A special story will become available to you.  This
story is just for fun, and you will therefore be allowed to see all of it
as well as being able to add as many words as you like.

<P>
A condition of retirement from these experiments is that you
<B>must NOT reveal the content of the stories to anybody else!
Doing so will result in instant disqualification!</B>

<P>
If you agree with this condition, and understand that
you will no longer be able to participate, then click the button below to
formally retire, and get access to the results:
