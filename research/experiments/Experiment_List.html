After almost exactly three years I have resurrected my online experiments
as a proof-of-concept for Ai's Online Laboratory.

<H2>Category #1: Story Writing</H2>

(please read the <A HREF="Story_Information.html">rules and information</A>
for this experiment <I>before</I> you begin)
<P>
These experiments are all to do with collective consciousness.  Your task
is to participate in writing a story with thousands of other people.  You
write one word at a time, and you can only see a few of the previous words
(from 1 through to 15).  There are three genre's of story, which means there
are twenty-four individual experiments.  To qualify for the prize money, you
must add at least one word to each of the stories.
<P>
<?
	if($story<24) {
		echo "<B>You have added at least one word to $story of the 24 stories.</B>";
	} else {
		echo "<B>You have added at least one word to each of the 24 stories!</B>";
	}
?>
<P>
In the list below, the number shown in square brackets indicates the number
of words you have added to that particular story.  If the "Add Word" isn't
a hyperlink,
it means that you can't currently add anything to that story, because your
previously added word is still visible.

<H2>Category #2: Prediction</H2>

(please read the <A HREF="Prediction_Information.html">rules and
information</A> for this experiment <I>before</I> you begin)
<P>
These experiments are all to do with prediction.  Your task is to predict
which symbol follows a short sequence of symbols.  The symbols may be either
English words, or letters from the alphabet.  To qualify for the prize
money, you must complete each of the <? echo $num_predict; ?> experiments
in this section.

<UL><LI>
<?
	if($predict<$num_predict) {
		echo "<A HREF=\"Prediction.html\">Prediction experiment #".($predict+1)." of $num_predict (you've done $position of $length symbols)</A>.";
	} else {
		echo "<B>You have completed all $num_predict of the prediction experiments!</B>";
	}
?>
</LI></UL>

<H2>Category #3: Segmentation</H2>

(please read the <A HREF="Segmentation_Information.html">rules and
information</A> for this experiment <I>before</I> you begin)
<P>
These experiments are all to do with segmentation.  Your task is to examine
a page of characters carefully.  The characters on the page are from some
sort of a language, but all of the spaces between words have been removed.
Once you have examined the page of characters, you will be asked to choose,
from a list of possibilities, the valid "words" in the language.
To qualify for the prize money, you must complete each of the
<? echo $num_segment; ?> experiments in this section.

<UL><LI>
<?
	if($segment<$num_segment) {
		echo "<A HREF=\"Segmentation.html\">Try the next segmentation experiment (#".($segment+1)." of $num_segment)</A>.";
	} else {
		echo "<B>You have completed all $num_segment of the segmentation experiments!</B>";
	}
?>
</LI></UL>

<H2>Category #4: Smoothing</H2>

(please read the <A HREF="Smoothing_Information.html">rules and
information</A> for this experiment <I>before</I> you begin)
<P>
These experiments are all to do with smoothing.  Your task is to guess which
word should appear in a sentence in order to make it complete.  You will
be presented with a sentence which has one word blanked out, and you need
to guess what the missing word is.
To qualify for the prize money, you must complete each of the
<? echo $num_smooth; ?> experiments in this section.

<UL><LI>
<?
	if($smooth<$num_smooth) {
		echo "<A HREF=\"Smoothing.html\">Try the next smoothing experiment (#".($smooth+1)." of $num_smooth)</A>.";
	} else {
		echo "<B>You have completed all $num_smooth of the smoothing experiments!</B>";
	}
?>
</LI></UL>

<H2>Thankyou!</H2>

I'll end this page by saying a big THANK-YOU to you for participating in these
experiments.  By doing this, you are helping me to complete my research, and
I am extremely grateful.
