<BR></UL><UL>
How are you?

Don’t ask.  I’m feeling kinda poor right now.  It just hasn’t been a good week for me.
</UL><UL>
are you sick mentally or physically?
</UL><UL>
All week I’ve been feeling sick in my stomach on account of my boss.  I got into real trouble at work.  I think I’m going to get fired.
</UL><UL>
are you taking pepto?
</UL><UL>
Of course not.  I never stole anything in my life.  But they always blame the cleaners whenever anything is missing.
