<H2>Introduction</H2>

In CIIPS we have a tradition of informal weekly seminars.  Over the previous
couple of years I have presented my fair share of them; beginning with
overheads, graduating to Powerpoint, and finally moving on to Web-based
talks.  Here you can find a collection of the seminars I've presented.

<H3><A HREF="Unavailable.html"><I>Grammatical Inference - A Magical Mystery Tour</I></A></H3>

<I>
How do children learn language?  Is it already in their heads when they are
born, or do they acquire language through experience?  Is it possible to
program a computer to learn a language using techniques which are possibly
available to the human infant?
<P>
Grammatical Inference strives to automatically infer a grammar for a language
from a subset of the strings in the language, and possibly also a set of
strings not in the language.
There are many useful applications which will benefit from a general
Grammatical Inference Engine, such as speech and image recognition, natural
language processing systems, and database query engines.

<H3><A HREF="talk2/sld001.htm"><I>How To Pass The Turing Test By Cheating</I></A></H3>

<I>
In 1991, the Cambridge Centre for Behavioural Studies held the first formal
instantiation of the Turing Test.  In this incarnation the test was known as
the Loebner contest, as Dr. Hugh Loebner pledged a \$100,000 grand prize for
the first computer program to pass the test.
I have submitted two computer programs to the 1996 Loebner contest, which is
to be held on Friday April 19 in New York city.  These computer programs are
nothing more than glorious hacks, but in constructing them I have learned a
great deal about how language works.
</I>

<H3><A HREF="talk3/sld001.htm"><I>Language Modeling and Text Compression</I></A></H3>

<I>
Data compression is bound up with grammatical inference and prediction.
If we can infer a grammar for some data, we may use that grammar to
compress that data and to predict what data is likely to occur in the
future.
</I>

<H3><A HREF="talk4/"><I>Chunking to Compress Data</I></A></H3>

<I>
Modern data compression schemes tend to fall into one of two classes:
adaptive dictionary encoders and finite-context encoders.  A hybrid
data compression scheme, combining features from both classes, may prove
to be a winner.  In this talk I present a statistical encoder which uses
an adaptive dictionary.  Entropic chunking is used to discover new dictionary
entries.
</I>

<H3><A HREF="Unavailable.html"><I>Solresol: A Musical Language</I></A></H3>

<I>
This is the subject of my next talk, which will be given in a few months
time.  It is intended to be a fun, entertaining and non-technical seminar.
Solresol is an Artificial Language, created in France in the 1800's.
The alphabet contains only 7 symbols: Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La and Ti,
which correspond to the white keys on a piano keyboard.
