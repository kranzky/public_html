<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: webbot guide</H1>
<P>Teaching WebBot is quite simple.  You, as teacher, can</P>
<UL>
<LI>stimulate WebBot;</LI>
<LI>reward WebBot;</LI>
<LI>punish WebBot; and</LI>
<LI>shape WebBot's behaviour.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In this document we shall discuss each of these processes in order.  We
shall then describe the output you will receive whenever you perform one
of these four teaching processes, and how you may use this output to guide
your teaching.</P>
<H2>Stimulating WebBot</H2>
<P>WebBot is a simple stimulus/response system.  You may stimulate WebBot
by simply typing some text to it.  The goal of teaching WebBot is to get it
to emit appropriate responses to your stimuli.  In this case, the possible
responses are five web navigation actions, and one response which covers the
case where none of the other responses apply.  These six responses are</P>
<UL>
<LI>unable to respond;</LI>
<LI>go back one page;</LI>
<LI>view the help page;</LI>
<LI>email the page author;</LI>
<LI>go to the home page; and</LI>
<LI>perform a search.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Stimulate WebBot by typing whatever you'd like to be associated with one
of the six actions shown above, and then press enter or the button marked
"Stimulate".  You can use English (for example, "take me
to the home page" or "write a letter to the author"), you can use nonsensical
words (for example, "google" to perform a search), or you can use any language
you like!</P>
<P>After you've stimulated WebBot, it will respond by telling you which action
it wants to perform.  Your role as teacher is one of deciding whether the
action is appropriate or not, and changing the behaviour of WebBot by
administering punishments and rewards, or by shaping.</P>
<H2>Rewarding WebBot</H2>
<P>You may reward WebBot by pressing the button marked "Reward".  WebBot will
be rewarded, and will respond to your stimulus once more.  You can continue
rewarding WebBot's response as much as you like.</P>
<H2>Punishing WebBot</H2>
<P>You may punish WebBot by pressing the button marked "Punish".  WebBot
will be punished, and will respond to your stimulus once more.  You can
continue punishing WebBot in this way as much as you like.</P>
<H2>Shaping WebBot's Behaviour</H2>
<P>The punishment/reward process can be automated by selecting the desired
response, then pressing the button marked "Shape".  WebBot will be repeatedly
punished and rewarded until its response matches the desired response, and
the strength of its response exceeds the strengths of all other possible
responses.</P>
<H1>WebBot Output</H1>
<P>Whenever you perform one of the four teaching processes, output from WebBot
will be displayed.  This output consists of</P>
<UL>
<LI>the response emitted by WebBot;</LI>
<LI>an information message letting you know whether the previous response
was accepted, rewarded or punished, or whether the shaping process has
succeeded; and</LI>
<LI>a table which lists all possible responses along with the strength of
the response.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The latter of these three outputs is the most interesting.  As you punish
and reward WebBot, the strength of the responses will change accordingly.
Positive response strengths indicate a strong association between your
stimulus and WebBot's response, while negative response strengths indicate
a repulsion.</P>
