<H2>Version 1.5: 19/08/2000</H2>
<P>Welcome!  This web page is the home of WebBot, a simple proof-of-concept
implementation of a web-based, natural language, web navigation system.
Sounds complicated, doesn't it?  Well, it isn't, really.  The job of WebBot
is to read a sentence from the user (such as "take me to the home page") and
to perform the corresponding action.</P>
<P>At the moment, WebBot is not able to do this.  So what use is it at all?
Well, it is possible to teach WebBot the actions which it should perform on
behalf of the user.  In fact, to begin with, WebBot has no idea at all how
to behave, and you must teach it from scratch.  But this process isn't as
boring as it sounds.  WebBot learns quickly!</P>
<P>I suggest that you begin by reading the <A HREF="Guide.html">WebBot
Teaching Guide</A> to find out everything you need to know to teach the
system.  You might then want to view an <A HREF="Example.html">example
training session</A>.  After that, you'll probably be keen to
<A HREF="Teach.html">teach
WebBot how to behave</A>.  A non-technical explanation of <A HREF="How.html">how
WebBot works</A> is available.  I would be interested to hear how you get on,
so please <A HREF="mailto:hutch@tmbg.org">send me an email</A> when you're
done, and let me know what you think.  Finally, if you're curious as to how
WebBot works, you may view the <A HREF="design.pdf">WebBot design
documentation</A> which contains a description of the program code, and the
program code itself.  A list of <A HREF="Changes.html">changes</A> made to
the online WebBot is also available for the curious.  Have fun!</P>
