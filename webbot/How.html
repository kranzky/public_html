<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: how webbot works</H1>
<P>This page is an attempt to explain, in non-technical terms, how WebBot
actually works.</P>
<P>WebBot starts life with a very small amount of hard-wired knowledge,
consisting of the six actions which it is able to perform.  The job of the
teacher is to get WebBot to associate the user input with the appropriate
action.</P>
<P>When presented with an input sentence, WebBot begins by converting all
of the characters in the sentence to their uppercase equivalents, and then
segmenting the sentence into a collection of unique words.  That is, no word
is included in this collection more than once.</P>
<P>In order to select the action to perform, WebBot measures the average
"informational magnetism" between the collection of input words and each of
the six possible actions.
<H2>"Informational Magnetism"</H2>
<P>"Informational magnetism" may be thought of as a force.  It is possible
to calculate the "informational magnetism" between any word and any action.
The result is a number which may be positive, negative or zero.  If the
number is positive, the force is attractive.  If the number is negative, the
force is repulsive.  The magnitude of the number is indicative of the
strength of the force.</P>
<P>Believe it or not, there is a mathematically precise way of calculating
the "informational magnetism" between a word and an action.  This calculation
requires us to estimate some probabilities: the probability of performing
the action, the probability of seeing the word in the collection, and the
probability of performing the action <I>given</I> that the word is in the
collection.  These first two probabilities may be estimated by counting
occurrences of words in the user's input, and accepted actions, while the last
is estimated by the teaching process.</P>
<P>Each of the words in the collection repel or attract the six possible
actions with varying strengths.  We calculate the average attraction between
the collection and a particular action by performing a weighted average.  That
is, we sum the "informational magnetism" between each word in the collection
and the action, multiplied by the probability of seeing the word and performing
the action.</P>
<H2>Selecting a Response</H2>
<P>WebBot selects an action to perform by calculating the "informational
magnetism" between the user input and each of the six possible actions.
The action which is attracted to the user input with the greatest strength
is selected.  If more than one action is attracted with the greatest
strength, WebBot selects between them at random.</P>
<H2>Teaching WebBot</H2>
<P>Teaching WebBot consists of punishing and rewarding its responses (shaping
is nothing more than an automation of this process).  Punishments and rewards
change our estimate of the probability of performing the action <I>given</I>
that the word occurs in the user input.</P>
<P>This probability is changed as follows.  To begin with, for a particular
word, each action is assigned a weight of one.  The probability of the action
given the word is estimated by dividing the weight of the action by the sum
of the weights of all possible actions.  That is, in the beginning the
probability of each action is one-sixth.<p>
<P>If a particular action is punished, the weight of the action is multiplied
by some number less than one.  Currently, this number is one-half.  If a
punishment is administered in the case above, the probability of the punished
action, given the word, will be half the probability of the other five
actions.</P>
<P>If a particular action is rewarded, the weight of the action is divided
by the punishment factor, which, in this case, is equivalent to multiplying
the weight of the action by two.  In the above case, the probability of
the rewarded action, given the word, will be twice the probability of the
other five actions.</P>
<P>This method has the advantage that punishments and rewards cancel out.
That is, if you punish the program for doing something, and then immediately
reward it, or vice versa, then you're back where you begun.  The reward
cancels the punishment!</P>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>And that's how WebBot works!</P>
