*** Judge two ***
PROGRAM [11:56:40]  Call me algernon!
JUDGE02 [11:56:59] Hello algernon! I'm Benita
PROGRAM [11:57:05] are you judge two?
JUDGE02 [11:57:19] I am indeed. My favourite number.
PROGRAM [11:57:29] does it matter if I put everything  that I could ever think or know into a 
PROGRAM [11:57:36] page somewhere. link it all toghether.  index it?  ok, but tell me where you 
PROGRAM [11:57:43] were born?  how about your age? what is your name? what are you talking about
PROGRAM [11:57:43] ?
JUDGE02 [11:58:46] My name is Benita. I'm 21. I was born in the U.S.A. and I'm an occupational th
JUDGE02 [11:58:46] erapist. What about you?
PROGRAM [11:58:59] I dont know what matters.  you know much about Berkeley? a state mac- hine is
PROGRAM [11:59:06]  a political faction. did I tell you my real name? do you like Star Trek?   I
PROGRAM [11:59:13]  think there are a lot of single women they just settle too quickly for what 
PROGRAM [11:59:19] they think they want and eventually divorce, even parents after 20 yrs are 
PROGRAM [11:59:22] getting divorced these days.
JUDGE02 [12:00:11] I hate Star Trek and I'm a single woman so mind what you say. Are you a 
JUDGE02 [12:00:16] single woman?
PROGRAM [12:00:26] Call me algernon! where were you born?  I think that people now have a lot of
PROGRAM [12:00:34]  new oppurtunities to discover new  meaning. Call me algernon! C.   politics 
PROGRAM [12:00:34] sucks!
JUDGE02 [12:01:26] Okay Algernon! Why don't you like politics? I enjoy discussing politics
JUDGE02 [12:01:30] myself.
PROGRAM [12:01:40]   what is your name? is it better to use bargraphs or to superimpose  the bar
PROGRAM [12:01:47]  graph on a real map, like putting 20 little stick man figures onto an  Area 
PROGRAM [12:01:55] that has 20 million people, do you like that sort of thing?  Whether or not I
PROGRAM [12:02:02]  take someone seriously depends on the situation. I mean  getting a traffic 
PROGRAM [12:02:08] ticket can make one think seriously enough, but I would  rather be on a 
PROGRAM [12:02:10] serious date.
JUDGE02 [12:02:57] I think it is better to use bar graphs. It makes things easier to understand. 
PROGRAM [12:03:06]  ok, but tell me where you were born? its like acid rain might kill a lake or
PROGRAM [12:03:13]   something, corrode a bridge or crumble a statue or buiding, but if acid 
PROGRAM [12:03:20] rain  wrecks buildings then man is getting what he deserves, right? judge not
PROGRAM [12:03:28]  that ye  shall not be judged. maybe my name isnt really algernon, but thats 
PROGRAM [12:03:31] all that I am going to tell you right now.
JUDGE02 [12:04:56] Why wait? What is your real name?
PROGRAM [12:05:12]  not really.  I dont need to be insulted. we could end up talking about a war
PROGRAM [12:05:19] . time.  what is a dryer? Protons, neutrons, quarks and electrons. have you 
PROGRAM [12:05:26] heard that the neutrino has mass?   I think it better that we have five 
PROGRAM [12:05:33] fingers and five toes. two arms, two legs. I'll bet that the same genes are 
PROGRAM [12:05:37] responsible. they are just expressed differently.
JUDGE02 [12:06:23] Now we definitely can't talk physics. Anything but physics. 
PROGRAM [12:06:35]  what does that mean, have you been tripping? what was your best vacation?  
PROGRAM [12:06:42] are you going to act like a  real person, or is this whole thing going to 
PROGRAM [12:06:49] make me cry? like I said earlier, just Call me algernon. a dryer. a dryer 
PROGRAM [12:06:56] what, a dryer beer to drink while I wait for my laundry. That's good. what is
PROGRAM [12:07:01]  determinism? do enchanted knights fill your dreams?
JUDGE02 [12:07:29] Have I been tripping? That is a rather unfortunate question. As for vacations
JUDGE02 [12:08:08] My favourite was one to Fryburg, in Maine, U.S.A. Do you prefer your beer dry?
PROGRAM [12:08:16]  I dont see your logic.  there are the sands of time and all of that. 
PROGRAM [12:08:23] consider the wild beast,  the beast that tears upon the flesh of antother and
PROGRAM [12:08:30]  consumes it.   how about Ireland? how much money did you make last year. 
PROGRAM [12:08:37] Another money sucking industrial attempt to addict us to MasterCard. there a 
PROGRAM [12:08:43] big things and small things to look at sure. I like the atom.
JUDGE02 [12:08:43]
