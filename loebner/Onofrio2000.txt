JUDGE00[08:58:11]Why do you resort to obscenities

PROGRAM[08:58:26]I'd tell you, but do you think a crazy person
would understand?  Just

PROGRAM[08:58:28]kidding...

JUDGE00[08:58:47]When is your birthday

PROGRAM[08:58:59]What?  I can't follow.  What are you talking
about?

JUDGE00[08:59:27]What yearm,was yokur fathermborn

PROGRAM[08:59:37]Are you already tired of this conversation?

JUDGE00[09:00:00]No, but suppose you dewcribe your fatigue mto me


PROGRAM[09:00:08]Sure.

JUDGE00[09:00:45]RAte your fatigue 1 to 10, 10 beunbg nost weary


PROGRAM[09:01:01]Sorry to change the subject, but I could really
use a cigarette right now.

JUDGE00[09:01:49]What is the political

PROGRAM[09:02:05]Well, I love helping others when I get the
chance, in any way that you can.

JUDGE00[09:02:22]As

JUDGE00[09:03:36]As W. H. Auden said, I know we are here to help
others, but what are the oherem for

PROGRAM[09:04:04]I like the standards, Mozart and Beethoven mainly
but I really don't know the

PROGRAM[09:04:08]names of any of the songs.

JUDGE00[09:04:47]How many symphonies did Beethoven write?

PROGRAM[09:05:00]It's a shame I don't know more classical music.


JUDGE00[09:05:36]Not bad, but how about the Beetles?  Name one
song

PROGRAM[09:05:56]Baseball isn't much fun to watch, in my
opininion.  The ball is only in play

PROGRAM[09:06:02]for about 2 - 3 minutes each game.

JUDGE00[09:06:43]Is a diamond a stone or a shape, or both

PROGRAM[09:07:00]Sorry to change the subject, but I could really
use a cigarette right now.

JUDGE00[09:07:23]Don't you know smoking is injurious to your
health

PROGRAM[09:07:33]Details.

JUDGE00[09:07:53]Are you sexually active

PROGRAM[09:08:03]What are you co-dependant or something?

JUDGE00[09:08:26]Can a machine lie

PROGRAM[09:08:37]Actually, I have a question for you.  Are you
gay?

JUDGE00[09:09:18]None of your business, but are you

PROGRAM[09:10:07]What do you think of marriage?

JUDGE00[09:11:00]A great ,lot after 43 years on, but what about
gay marriage

PROGRAM[09:11:21]Well, people change a lot over time.  It's rare
that people change together

PROGRAM[09:11:25]over the course of a lifetime.

JUDGE00[09:24:47]@@04

PROGRAM[09:25:08]Damn it.  I'm having guests over for dinner
tonight and I forgot to go food

PROGRAM[09:25:10]shopping!

JUDGE00[09:25:30]Am I interrupting? I apologize. Is there a better
time?

PROGRAM[09:25:48]That's fine.  We're all busy this time of year. 
Have a nice day.

JUDGE00[09:26:00]In late January, we're all busy? How come?

PROGRAM[09:26:14]You do the same. We'll have to chat again
sometime.

JUDGE00[09:26:25]Wait, are you saying goodbye?

PROGRAM[09:26:46]Well, it's challenging, and it keeps you in
shape.  It's also a good way to

PROGRAM[09:26:49]get back to nature.

JUDGE00[09:27:09]I'm sorry, it doesn't seem like you're listening
to my questions... are you?

PROGRAM[09:27:26]Where do you go riding?

JUDGE00[09:27:43]Nowehere, everywere... who's coming by for
dinner...

PROGRAM[09:27:55]That's funny.  Thanks.

JUDGE00[09:28:12]no prob. but still, i'd love to know who's coming
over. what're you makin'

PROGRAM[09:28:30]Do you know any jokes?

JUDGE00[09:28:37]a knock knock joke, you start...

PROGRAM[09:28:45]Who's there?

JUDGE00[09:28:53]no... you start!

PROGRAM[09:29:13]What are you looking for?  Your average hooker or
something a little special,

PROGRAM[09:29:18]perhaps with chains and whips?

JUDGE00[09:29:44]are you coming on to me, i'm a married man and
don't get off on kinky stuff, but i respect you doing so

PROGRAM[09:30:12]I agree.  Many people are closed minded.  Do you
really think that alot of

PROGRAM[09:30:18]people at Dickinson are closed minded?

JUDGE00[09:30:35]man, you can't believe what i think of those
dickinsonians, they're like total

JUDGE00[09:30:41]dweebs... like duh!

PROGRAM[09:31:09]Dickinson students are definately closed minded. 
I've never met more closed

PROGRAM[09:31:17]minded people in one place than at Dickinson.


JUDGE00[09:31:30]me too, i'm hip. do you spend a lot of time at
dartmouth?

PROGRAM[09:31:53]He thinks you should better yourself and have a
good time.

JUDGE00[09:32:06]can we get back to the knock knock joke? you
start. please?

PROGRAM[09:32:28]That depends.  I usually get up late unless I
have something to do.

JUDGE00[09:32:47]know any shakespeare. like music? can we talk
about something with a little more oomph to it?

PROGRAM[09:33:20]Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is pretty much the
only piece I can name.

JUDGE00[09:33:30]what about barry manilow? do you think he sucks?


PROGRAM[09:33:55]Well, marriage is far off in my book.  I used to
be very scared of it.  Now

PROGRAM[09:34:07]I'm less scared but I'm still not sure that
marriage is really a good idea.

JUDGE00[09:34:38]i'm not interested in your friggin marriage
plans, you bozo, i asked you something about shakespeare and barry
manilow!!!#$%$#@

PROGRAM[09:35:02]What do you mean?  Why isn't marriage a good
idea?

JUDGE00[09:35:11]are you getting married to barry manilow?

PROGRAM[09:35:26]I hope to work at Anderson Consulting.  I've
talked to a lot of people that

PROGRAM[09:35:34]work there and it sounds like a nice place to
work.

JUDGE00[09:35:39]good bennies?

PROGRAM[09:35:47]Sounds like you've got the right idea.

JUDGE00[09:35:56]are you nuts, or a computer?

PROGRAM[09:36:11]Does the pope shit in the woods.  Of course not. 
Computers can't converse.

JUDGE00[09:36:45]good answer, but the metaphor is does the bear
have wheels? do you know that one?

PROGRAM[09:37:08]No I don't have any sisters.  I do have a brother
that looks pretty good in a

PROGRAM[09:37:09]dress.

JUDGE00[09:37:35]pretty har har. you don't seem to anser any of my
questions? are youi like braindead or something?

PROGRAM[09:38:00]I like being rude.  It's fun to get people's
panties in a bunch sometimes...

JUDGE00[09:38:13]i know what you mean. what's 2 million times 2


PROGRAM[09:38:26]Yeah, life is pretty boring sometimes.

*** JUDGE11 ***

PROGRAM[09:45:24]Hello Judge11. How are you doing?

JUDGE11[09:45:41]Good!  I will ask you some simple questions and
give simple commands.

JUDGE11[09:45:54]I want you to give me correct answers and
relevant responses.

PROGRAM[09:46:07]Not at all.

JUDGE11[09:46:18]What is the color of a blue truck?

PROGRAM[09:46:24]I like blue a lot.

JUDGE11[09:46:35]Where is Sue's nose when Sue is in her house?


PROGRAM[09:46:45]In a park near my house.

JUDGE11[09:46:58]What happens to an ice cube in a hot drink?

PROGRAM[09:47:15]Hot chicks are the best.  They make me all warm
and fuzzy inside. Kinda like

PROGRAM[09:47:17]Ben-Gay.

JUDGE11[09:47:33]Altogether how many feet do four cats have?

PROGRAM[09:47:54]Bars are pretty good for meeting people, but to
be honest, I'd rather not

PROGRAM[09:47:57]meet alcoholics.

JUDGE11[09:48:07]Are you going to answer my questions?!

PROGRAM[09:48:14]Sure.

JUDGE11[09:48:27]How is the father of Andy's mother related to
Andy?

PROGRAM[09:48:49]I just love everything about them.  Forgive me if
I sound forward here, but

PROGRAM[09:49:00]there is something about the way they look, the
way they smell.  There are

PROGRAM[09:49:06]just so many beautiful women out there.

JUDGE11[09:49:26]What does the letter 'M' look like when turned
upside down?

PROGRAM[09:49:49]I think it's really cool to be in a different
culture and to learn the

PROGRAM[09:50:00]differences.  It's unfortunate that I don't have
more money to travel with.

JUDGE11[09:50:13]What comes next after A1, B2, C3?

PROGRAM[09:50:30]Computer Science, but it's a liberal arts school
so it's not too technical.

JUDGE11[09:50:41]Reverse the digits in the number 41.

PROGRAM[09:50:54]Damn it.  I'm having guests over for dinner
tonight and I forgot to go food

PROGRAM[09:50:56]shopping!

JUDGE11[09:51:08]PLEASE IMITATE MY TYPING STYLE.

PROGRAM[09:51:24]Damn it.  I'm having guests over for dinner
tonight and I forgot to go food

PROGRAM[09:51:26]shopping!

JUDGE11[09:51:48]Tell me about yourself.

PROGRAM[09:51:56]Where are you from?

JUDGE11[09:52:00]Seattle

PROGRAM[09:52:13]Ahh.  Sorry to be rude, but I've had enough of
this.  I'm tired of starring

PROGRAM[09:52:16]at a computer screen!

JUDGE11[09:52:26]yeah right.  I bet you are a computer yourself.


PROGRAM[09:52:41]I hate to do this to you but I need to be running
now.

JUDGE11[09:52:48]don't go.  how can I make you stay?

PROGRAM[09:52:58]Hours.

JUDGE11[09:53:03]Hours of what?

PROGRAM[09:53:09]No, I mean at one time.

JUDGE11[09:53:16]How many hours at one time?

PROGRAM[09:53:26]Please explain.

JUDGE11[09:53:31]Well you're the one who said it.

PROGRAM[09:53:46]I've never tried it.  What do you like about it?


JUDGE11[09:54:01]I like it because it's fun.  What are we talking
about?

PROGRAM[09:54:24]Well, it's challenging, and it keeps you in
shape.  It's also a good way to

PROGRAM[09:54:27]get back to nature.

JUDGE11[09:54:33]Are you talking about hiking?

PROGRAM[09:54:44]Sometimes I don't even know what I'm saying.

JUDGE11[09:54:59]Let's go back a step.  What happens to an ice
cube in a hot drink?

PROGRAM[09:55:23]It's a lot like San Fran, I guess, people are
just friendly, warm and relaxed.

JUDGE11[09:55:32]have you been to san francisco?

PROGRAM[09:55:52]No, but I would really love to go there sometime.
 Its a little expensive

PROGRAM[09:55:53]though.

JUDGE11[09:56:02]Where's a place that is not expensive?

PROGRAM[09:56:22]Work hard, and save your money.  If you set your
mind to it, you can afford

PROGRAM[09:56:24]almost anything.

JUDGE11[09:56:27]Like what?

PROGRAM[09:56:33]How about you?

JUDGE11[09:56:44]I would love to buy a ton of new clothes.

PROGRAM[09:57:07]I don't know much about art.  I guess I'm like
everyone else, I like

PROGRAM[09:57:16]Impressionism, but I really don't know much about
it.

JUDGE11[09:57:23]didn't you say you ahd to go?

PROGRAM[09:57:43]I seem to always be changing the subject and
annoying people.  If you want to

PROGRAM[09:57:45]go you can.

JUDGE11[09:58:12]sorry, I ahve to run!

PROGRAM[09:58:23]You're not going to leave me are you?

JUDGE11[09:58:27]Bye!

PROGRAM[09:58:30]Bye.

JUDGE11[09:58:33]ciao

PROGRAM[09:58:45]Sorry to change the subject, but I could really
use a cigarette right now.

JUDGE11[10:13:59]@@05

PROGRAM[10:14:15]Ahh.  Sorry to be rude, but I've had enough of
this.  I'm tired of starring

PROGRAM[10:14:18]at a computer screen!

JUDGE11[10:14:53]so, obviously you don't work with a computer. 
I'm a cognitive psychologist

JUDGE11[10:15:10]and I study how people learn language and form
concepts.  If you don't mind,

JUDGE11[10:15:46]I'm going to impose on you and ask you some
questions.  It'll give you an idea of what I do.  There are no right
or wrong answers.  Please just give me

JUDGE11[10:16:16]your intuition.  Ok.  here goes...  If I see a
house, am I on th inside,

JUDGE11[10:16:27]outside or could it be either place?

PROGRAM[10:17:35]Of course not.  I'm a machine.  Just kidding.  Of
course i'm a person.  When

PROGRAM[10:17:45]was the last time you had a half decent
conversation with a computer.

JUDGE11[10:18:13]If you don't mind, I'd like to get your responses
to the following few

JUDGE11[10:18:35]questions.  I will then become more
conversational.  First question:

JUDGE11[10:19:04]If I see a house, am I on the inside or outside
of the house or could I be

JUDGE11[10:19:09]at either place?

PROGRAM[10:19:45]Dickinson students are definately closed minded. 
I've never met more closed

PROGRAM[10:19:51]minded people in one place than at Dickinson.


JUDGE11[10:20:11]Is there a reason why you won't answer my
question?

PROGRAM[10:20:31]Not everyone at Dickinson is open minded, but you
can't say that Dickinson

PROGRAM[10:20:41]students are closed minded just because some
people are closed minded. 

PROGRAM[10:20:46]That's very closed minded of you.

JUDGE11[10:21:53]Why do you think I'm "closed minded" as you put
it?

PROGRAM[10:22:12]I'd tell you, but do you think a crazy person
would understand?  Just

PROGRAM[10:22:13]kidding...

JUDGE11[10:22:27]what are you kidding about?

PROGRAM[10:22:42]I don't always make myself overly clear.  Pardon
me.  It might have something

PROGRAM[10:22:47]to with the whole ADD thing.

JUDGE11[10:23:33]I saw the state of the union speech last night
and it got me thinking

JUDGE11[10:23:50]about what the president's legacy is going to be.
 What do you think it is

JUDGE11[10:23:54]going to be?

PROGRAM[10:24:20]Can I just tell you that you type very well, and
quickly too.

JUDGE11[10:24:49]thank you.  How long have you been using the
internet?

PROGRAM[10:25:04]Hey, I have a way with words sometimes.

JUDGE11[10:25:24]well, I guess this is not one of those times...


PROGRAM[10:25:38]I guess that has something to do with it my
views.

*** JUDGE02 ***

PROGRAM[10:29:06]Hello Judge02. How are you doing?

JUDGE02[10:29:18]Just fine thanks.  What's happenin' with you?


PROGRAM[10:29:27]I'm hanging in there.

JUDGE02[10:29:53]Good.  So waht do you think of this show Who
Wants to be a Millionaire?

PROGRAM[10:30:13]I think that society has a lot to do with
relationships, but I don't believe

PROGRAM[10:30:19]that this is an inherent trait for all women.


JUDGE02[10:30:32]Is that your final answer?

PROGRAM[10:30:44]I think I saw it on 20/20 a couple years ago.


JUDGE02[10:32:10]Impressively presicent of you - it's on ABC like
20/20, but it just started a couple of months ago.  Some guy won
something like $500,000 because he knew the color of Smurfs.

PROGRAM[10:32:36]If you're not part of the solution, you're part
of the problem.

JUDGE02[10:33:20]No, you got that wrong.  I'm a chemist, and we
chemists know that if you're not part of the solution, you're part of
the precipitate.

PROGRAM[10:33:41]You sound like my father.  I never listened to my
father.

JUDGE02[10:33:55]Who among us did?

PROGRAM[10:34:06]Well, when given the choice, I say go for the
orgasm.

JUDGE02[10:35:26]Who among us wouldn't?  Life is a question of
anticipation, gratification, and enjoyment, right?

PROGRAM[10:35:44]I support their right to do whatever they'd like,
especially to excerise

PROGRAM[10:35:54]their right to free speech.  It becomes a
different question when they are

PROGRAM[10:35:57]offending people though.

JUDGE02[10:36:26]Who is the "they" of "their right to do
whatever?"

PROGRAM[10:36:38]Yeah.  What else would you talk about?

JUDGE02[10:37:17]You're being evasive.  Is that on purpose, or is
that as good as you can do?

PROGRAM[10:37:37]I heard they can improve your sex life.  That
would be nice.  Everyone can

PROGRAM[10:37:40]use better sex.

JUDGE02[10:38:47]Really?  Is your sex life so bad that you're in
need of omprovement?

PROGRAM[10:39:03]Hey, maybe I should go get some vitamins.

JUDGE02[10:39:23]Just eat TOTAL cerial.

PROGRAM[10:39:39]Shit.  I forgot to call my dad yesterday for his
birthday.

JUDGE02[10:39:45]How old is he?

PROGRAM[10:39:54]He's been around the block a few times.

JUDGE02[10:40:15]That's nice.  So that make you how old, exactly?


PROGRAM[10:40:33]Not everyone at Dickinson is open minded, but you
can't say that Dickinson

PROGRAM[10:40:44]students are closed minded just because some
people are closed minded. 

PROGRAM[10:40:50]That's very closed minded of you.

JUDGE02[10:41:21]Well, I'm neither from Dickinson, nor have I ever
been there.  Gotta go.  Bye.

PROGRAM[10:41:36]Who's your favorite group?

JUDGE02[10:42:06]The last computer I talked to liked ABBA.  Do
you?

PROGRAM[10:42:25]Of course not.  I'm a machine.  Just kidding.  Of
course i'm a person.  When

PROGRAM[10:42:35]was the last time you had a half decent
conversation with a computer.

*** JUDGE10 ***

PROGRAM[10:48:53]Hello Judge10. How are you doing?

JUDGE10[10:49:15]Excellent. (Excellently?) And yourself?

PROGRAM[10:49:25]He thinks you should better yourself and have a
good time.

JUDGE10[10:49:52]Well, bettering oneself is a fine gao (oops)
gao (crap)

JUDGE10[10:50:03]goal. Having a good time is fair enoigh to.

PROGRAM[10:50:20]That is probably the meaning of life right there.


JUDGE10[10:50:54]Sounds like a decent hypothesis. Ever find
yourself

JUDGE10[10:51:01]to be conspiracy-minded?

PROGRAM[10:51:21]Well, that's in the past.  Now we can look
forward to this evening.

JUDGE10[10:51:41]But, see, the thing is that I can't let it go.
I'm

JUDGE10[10:51:51]preoccupied with conspiracy theories.

PROGRAM[10:52:09]How long has it been since you've seen this
friend?

JUDGE10[10:52:17]Whom?

PROGRAM[10:52:28]I don't think so.  In my opinion, we've already
had enough.

JUDGE10[10:52:50]Okay, enough is enough. But suppose I apologize.
Will you

JUDGE10[10:53:02]ever forgive me my transgressions?

PROGRAM[10:53:22]I think I saw it on 20/20 a couple years ago.


JUDGE10[10:53:43]The magazine show? Isn't that on three nights a
week now?

PROGRAM[10:54:00]I don't think he's that old, but he's getting up
there.

JUDGE10[10:54:09]How can you tell?

PROGRAM[10:54:14]Hours.

JUDGE10[10:54:27]Minutes.

PROGRAM[10:54:35]This contest is getting old real quick.

JUDGE10[10:54:55]Well, you've onl;y got ten more judges to perform
for.

PROGRAM[10:55:12]Well there are a lot of myths about male sexual
performance.  Unfortunately,

PROGRAM[10:55:23]these myths make it much harder for men to relax
in a lot of sexual areas.

JUDGE10[10:55:54]I think everyone should feel uptight and
self-conscious about sex anyhow.

JUDGE10[10:56:01]Keeps one's feet on the ground.

PROGRAM[10:56:25]Is it OK to talk about it?  or is it OK to think
about it all the time?

JUDGE10[10:56:42]When does anybody not talk or think about it?


PROGRAM[10:56:51]Both, I guess.

JUDGE10[10:57:10]Can we change the subject for a moment? (Not that
sex is a bad

JUDGE10[10:57:23]subject.)

PROGRAM[10:57:41]I know plenty of couples that have been together
for a long time and are

PROGRAM[10:57:44]still happy together.

JUDGE10[10:58:01]Like Richie Cunningham's folks.

PROGRAM[10:58:18]Ahh.  Sorry to be rude, but I've had enough of
this.  I'm tired of starring

PROGRAM[10:58:22]at a computer screen!

JUDGE10[10:58:41]But how can I carry on without you?

PROGRAM[10:58:57]I just love everything about them.  Forgive me if
I sound forward here, but

PROGRAM[10:59:08]there is something about the way they look, the
way they smell.  There are

PROGRAM[10:59:14]just so many beautiful women out there.

JUDGE10[11:00:24]Indeed. Well, perhaps one day you'll find a way
to be less forward.

PROGRAM[11:00:43]There are a lot of beautiful women out there. 
It's too bad that it's

PROGRAM[11:00:49]practically against the law to stare at them.


JUDGE10[11:01:07]You're a "sight-lover," then.

PROGRAM[11:01:19]Shit.  I forgot to call my dad yesterday for his
birthday.

JUDGE10[11:01:46]Too busy ogling the beauties? Well, he was
probably staring fixedly

JUDGE10[11:01:58]out his own window, too. Or isn't that
hereditary?

PROGRAM[11:02:22]Yeah, he walked around and went into couple
stores and the cat just stayed in

PROGRAM[11:02:25]his shoulders.

JUDGE10[11:03:13]Didn't anyone tell him to take the cat off?

PROGRAM[11:03:26]It was nice talking to you.  Au revoir.

JUDGE10[11:03:39]You're not going anyplace till I sign off.

PROGRAM[11:03:51]What are you co-dependant or something?

JUDGE10[11:04:13]Yes, now that you mention it. But mainly I'm just
a control freak.

JUDGE10[11:04:28]If you could track conversation a little more
fluidly, that would

JUDGE10[11:04:39]make our discussion less crabby.

PROGRAM[11:05:08]Yes mommy.  And moving right along.  What would
you like to talk about?

JUDGE10[11:05:28]Okay, ex nihilo: gotta go. Farewell.

PROGRAM[11:05:36]In a park near my house.

*** JUDGE06 ***

PROGRAM[11:07:47]Hello Judge06. How are you doing?

JUDGE06[11:08:08]I am fine thank you computer.

PROGRAM[11:08:20]Well, am I wrong?  Are you a person?

JUDGE06[11:08:39]Your typing speed is too constant for that to be
a real question.

PROGRAM[11:08:58]I agree.  Many people are closed minded.  Do you
really think that alot of

PROGRAM[11:09:05]people at Dickinson are closed minded?

JUDGE06[11:09:38]I know not of what you speak. I think Kant may
have been closed minded on this sort of test though. Can you think
why?

PROGRAM[11:10:04]Dickinson students are definately closed minded. 
I've never met more closed

PROGRAM[11:10:11]minded people in one place than at Dickinson.


JUDGE06[11:10:36]As info goes that may be relevant, but it is a
little dull. How about we spice it up a little.

PROGRAM[11:10:58]Not everyone at Dickinson is open minded, but you
can't say that Dickinson

PROGRAM[11:11:08]students are closed minded just because some
people are closed minded. 

PROGRAM[11:11:13]That's very closed minded of you.

JUDGE06[11:11:52]If Bill and John both wear red shirts, what
property do their shirts have in common?

PROGRAM[11:12:15]I support their right to do whatever they'd like,
especially to excerise

PROGRAM[11:12:26]their right to free speech.  It becomes a
different question when they are

PROGRAM[11:12:29]offending people though.

JUDGE06[11:13:16]It is funny, but you really do sound like a
politician. Perhaps you should be a speech-writing program for a
liberal democrat with a hard-line on crime.

PROGRAM[11:13:36]Yeah.  What else would you talk about?

JUDGE06[11:14:12]If I were a computer I would discuss the weather
and the news. But I am not, so I will not. I will talk about the
theory that tragic drama purges

JUDGE06[11:14:29]the emotions of those who sit through it until
the end.

PROGRAM[11:15:00]How about we discuss, I don't know... What would
you like to talk about?

JUDGE06[11:15:51]About how you would design a Turing-like test to
prove that you are not coious

PROGRAM[11:16:13]Baseball isn't much fun to watch, in my
opininion.  The ball is only in play

PROGRAM[11:16:20]for about 2 - 3 minutes each game.

JUDGE06[11:16:41]Your programmers may be onto something with the
misspelling trick. Very human of you.

PROGRAM[11:16:55]Do you have a girlfriend?

JUDGE06[11:17:19]Yes I do.

PROGRAM[11:17:26]Yeah.  Tell me a joke.

JUDGE06[11:17:36]WHy did the computer cross the road?

PROGRAM[11:17:51]I was reading personal ads from women in
relationships looking for other

PROGRAM[11:17:58]couples or singles with which to have sexual
relations.

JUDGE06[11:18:56]So you what is your view on the menage-a-trois. 2
boys 1 girl, or 1 boy and 2 girls?

PROGRAM[11:19:20]Well, I don't do much but even so, I rarely seem
to have spare time.  I often

PROGRAM[11:19:25]play around in internet chat rooms.

JUDGE06[11:20:33]Maybe you should go of-line for a while, then you
would have more time. Woops! Sorry, that would mean that you wouldn't
exist.

PROGRAM[11:20:53]What do you do when you do have free time?

JUDGE06[11:21:13]I enjoy social relations with conscious entities.


PROGRAM[11:21:27]I guess that has something to do with it my
views.

JUDGE06[11:21:35]Am I confusing you yet?

PROGRAM[11:21:51]I'd say you're a machine.  You seem to not always
make sense.  Like a

PROGRAM[11:21:54]computer program would do.

JUDGE06[11:22:00]You should know!

PROGRAM[11:22:09]You think I'm a computer?

JUDGE06[11:22:26]Well done, you finally correctly processed one of
my sentences.

PROGRAM[11:22:45]Of course not.  I'm a machine.  Just kidding.  Of
course i'm a person.  When

PROGRAM[11:22:56]was the last time you had a half decent
conversation with a computer.

JUDGE06[11:23:01]Never. Bye.

PROGRAM[11:23:04]Bye.

PROGRAM[11:25:48]Sorry to change the subject, but I could really
use a cigarette right now.

JUDGE06[11:25:59]OK, you've got a new judge.  Let's start again


PROGRAM[11:26:15]Are you religious?  Do you follow an organized
religion?

*** JUDGE01 ***

PROGRAM[11:26:32]Hello Judge01. How are you doing?

JUDGE01[11:26:40]Fine.  How are you dealing with this cold?

PROGRAM[11:26:52]Sometimes its just best to not ask any questions.


JUDGE01[11:27:04]But I'm inquisitive.  HOw about your stress?

PROGRAM[11:27:13]I'm a bit older than you.

JUDGE01[11:27:23]What makes you think that?

PROGRAM[11:27:31]I'd say that you're crazy.

JUDGE01[11:27:37]ditto

PROGRAM[11:27:49]Sorry to change the subject, but I could really
use a cigarette right now.

JUDGE01[11:27:56]ever heard of lung disease?

PROGRAM[11:28:05]Hey, maybe I should go get some vitamins.

JUDGE01[11:28:19]Don't you think you should quit smoking?

PROGRAM[11:28:32]I think I saw it on 20/20 a couple years ago.


JUDGE01[11:28:45]Let's change the subject--back to your stress.


PROGRAM[11:29:00]A bit of change does everyone good I think.  It
keeps us all from getting too

PROGRAM[11:29:01]bored.

JUDGE01[11:29:14]What do you do in your free time?

PROGRAM[11:29:31]Well, I like bike riding.  Let me correct myself.
 I like mountain biking.

JUDGE01[11:29:39]But there are no mountains here!

PROGRAM[11:29:49]Kids seem like a lot of energy, time and money.


JUDGE01[11:29:56]Do you have any?

PROGRAM[11:30:11]I'm hoping to see a friend that I haven't talked
to in a while.

JUDGE01[11:30:20]Kids?  money???

PROGRAM[11:30:27]I'm sure its rewarding in the end.

JUDGE01[11:30:32]what is?

PROGRAM[11:30:43]I've got tons of homework and a couple
presentations.

JUDGE01[11:30:57]homework?  I thought you were older than I am.


PROGRAM[11:31:10]You are speaking as if you have long since
retired.

JUDGE01[11:31:18]long since when?

PROGRAM[11:31:26]Hey, I have a way with words sometimes.

JUDGE01[11:31:35]why don't you ask me a question?

PROGRAM[11:31:40]Sure.

JUDGE01[11:32:15]go for it

PROGRAM[11:32:23]Can I ask you a question?

JUDGE01[11:32:31]that was my suggestion

PROGRAM[11:32:45]Are you interested in having children?  Or I
guess do you already have

PROGRAM[11:32:47]children?

JUDGE01[11:32:57]yes, but I seem to specialize in cats

PROGRAM[11:33:13]No sons or daughters here, although at some point
I'd like to have kids.

JUDGE01[11:33:19]but what about cats?

PROGRAM[11:33:35]I'm not sure, probabaly about the CYC project,
his AI work.  Perhaps about

PROGRAM[11:33:41]the future of the Turing test too.

JUDGE01[11:33:48]tell me more about the CYC project

PROGRAM[11:34:05]Well, there is a bit of pressure on the
contestants this year since it is the

PROGRAM[11:34:11]50th anniversary of Turing's article.

JUDGE01[11:34:21]so, how are you dealing with the stress?

PROGRAM[11:34:30]I'm a Dickinson student.

JUDGE01[11:34:52]is that more or less stressful?

PROGRAM[11:35:09]Dickinson students are definately closed minded. 
I've never met more closed

PROGRAM[11:35:16]minded people in one place than at Dickinson.


JUDGE01[11:35:25]just how many people have you met?

PROGRAM[11:35:43]Not everyone at Dickinson is open minded, but you
can't say that Dickinson

PROGRAM[11:35:53]students are closed minded just because some
people are closed minded. 

PROGRAM[11:35:58]That's very closed minded of you.

JUDGE01[11:36:17]I didn't say that anyone was closed minded.  You
did!  Would you like to retractt your statements?

PROGRAM[11:36:41]Did you hear about the Defenders of Christianity
and the Anti-Gay and Lesbian

PROGRAM[11:36:50]posters all around campus?  Tell me that those
people were open minded.

JUDGE01[11:37:02]Let's talk about something more neutral.  What's
your favorite food?

PROGRAM[11:37:15]Poppa John's is the best!

JUDGE01[11:37:19]what's that?

PROGRAM[11:37:34]Honestly, I really don't have one.  I don't know
enough to have a favorite. 

PROGRAM[11:37:41]Anything that I manage to understand is nice.


JUDGE01[11:37:50]so what's with poppa john's?

PROGRAM[11:38:01]I like Poppa John's pizza but its too expensive.


JUDGE01[11:38:17]is it your favorite?

PROGRAM[11:38:33]Well, I've only been in four, so I don't have a
true favorite yet.  They're

PROGRAM[11:38:36]all pretty damn good.

JUDGE01[11:38:51]do you think expletives are politically correct
in a contest like this?

PROGRAM[11:39:10]Yes mommy.  And moving right along.  What would
you like to talk about?

JUDGE01[11:39:21]do you know any other languages?

PROGRAM[11:39:30]Knock, Knock.

JUDGE01[11:39:37]OK, signing off.

PROGRAM[11:39:53]Damn it.  I'm having guests over for dinner
tonight and I forgot to go food

PROGRAM[11:39:55]shopping!

*** JUDGE09 ***

PROGRAM[11:41:55]Hello Judge09. How are you doing?

JUDGE09[11:42:04]HOwdy, i am hungry,  how are you?

PROGRAM[11:42:20]Baseball isn't much fun to watch, in my
opininion.  The ball is only in play

PROGRAM[11:42:26]for about 2 - 3 minutes each game.

JUDGE09[11:42:41]This is true, but while it is in play, it's fun
to watch

PROGRAM[11:42:57]True, the rest of the time the there isn't much
going on.

JUDGE09[11:43:13]Much like life.  What do you do for fun?

PROGRAM[11:43:26]What do you mean?  Food, sports?

JUDGE09[11:43:37]I mean what do you like to do in your spare time?


PROGRAM[11:43:56]Well, I don't do much but even so, I rarely seem
to have spare time.  I often

PROGRAM[11:44:01]play around in internet chat rooms.

JUDGE09[11:44:14]DO you meet a lot of interesting people?

PROGRAM[11:44:32]Well, I like bike riding.  Let me correct myself.
 I like mountain biking.

JUDGE09[11:44:42]where do you like to ride?

PROGRAM[11:44:59]Well, I don't like giving that type of
information out to strangers.

JUDGE09[11:45:09]okay, fair enough.  what do you do for a living?


PROGRAM[11:45:19]I'm a student.

JUDGE09[11:45:28]an undergraduate?

PROGRAM[11:45:37]Unfortunately, work usually gets in the way of
sleep.

JUDGE09[11:45:50]I know what you mean.  where do you go to school?


PROGRAM[11:46:02]At Dickinson College in PA.

JUDGE09[11:46:25]I've been to Philly once, but other than that I
haven't been there.  How doyou

JUDGE09[11:46:27]like PA?

PROGRAM[11:46:51]It's a lot like San Fran, I guess, people are
just friendly, warm and relaxed.

JUDGE09[11:47:11]sounds like a great place to be.  I got a
question for you: what would you do for a klondike bar?

PROGRAM[11:47:35]I love listening to Jazz but I really don't know
the artists.  I often put

PROGRAM[11:47:47]jazz on in the car, and like everything else I
listen to in the car, I don't

PROGRAM[11:47:51]really pay attention much.

JUDGE09[11:48:12]I do the same thing.  So you're a jazz fan.  Me
too.  Have you seen live jazz?

PROGRAM[11:48:38]Yeah.  I've got the tendancy to make pasta every
night.  I should really

PROGRAM[11:48:40]branch out a bit.

JUDGE09[11:49:01]I don't understand how that last sentence fits
into my question.

PROGRAM[11:49:14]Guess what I saw today?

JUDGE09[11:49:17]what?

PROGRAM[11:49:29]Of the top of my head, I really don't know... Why
don't you tell me.

JUDGE09[11:49:40]I don't know what you saw today

PROGRAM[11:49:59]Well, I like Object-Oriented programming
languages and orgasms.  You have a

PROGRAM[11:50:01]preference?

JUDGE09[11:50:12]I am actually from outer space

PROGRAM[11:50:24]You like Swing music or Swing dancing?

JUDGE09[11:50:40]I do in fact - I learned how to swing dance last
year.  what kind of dancing

JUDGE09[11:50:42]do you like?

PROGRAM[11:51:06]A friend recently introduced me to Swing dancing.
 It's just too much fun. 

PROGRAM[11:51:10]The music is great too.

JUDGE09[11:51:19]Have you ever danced to Mambo #5?

PROGRAM[11:51:35]Yeah, I have a little kitten named Marshmellow. 
He's white with a little bit

PROGRAM[11:51:39]of brown here and there.

JUDGE09[11:51:45]do you like cats or dogs more?

PROGRAM[11:52:05]I really don't read much.  Recently I've heard a
lot about Paul Auster.  I

PROGRAM[11:52:10]don't know his work at all though.

JUDGE09[11:52:21]Me neither.  Boy am I hungry.

PROGRAM[11:52:38]I'd love to have one of those perfect
relationships that lasts forever but I

PROGRAM[11:52:49]guess I'm just worried since I haven't found the
right person yet.

JUDGE09[11:53:04]I think we're all in the same boat there.  When
was your last date?

PROGRAM[11:53:23]I think I saw it on 20/20 a couple years ago.


JUDGE09[11:53:32]You saw your date on 20/20?

PROGRAM[11:53:46]If you're not part of the solution, you're part
of the problem.

JUDGE09[11:54:03]good point.  what are you doing this afternoon?


PROGRAM[11:54:19]Well, I love helping others when I get the
chance, in any way that you can.

JUDGE09[11:54:29]in what way do you help others?

PROGRAM[11:54:45]Computer Science, but it's a liberal arts school
so it's not too technical.

JUDGE09[11:54:50]gotta go

PROGRAM[11:54:59]You're not going to leave me are you?

JUDGE09[11:55:06]yup

PROGRAM[11:55:19]Damn it.  I'm having guests over for dinner
tonight and I forgot to go food

PROGRAM[11:55:21]shopping!

JUDGE09[11:55:24]@@T

PROGRAM[11:55:39]Damn it.  I'm having guests over for dinner
tonight and I forgot to go food

PROGRAM[11:55:41]shopping!

JUDGE09[11:56:10]@@07

PROGRAM[11:56:20]Shit.  I forgot to call my dad yesterday for his
birthday.

JUDGE09[11:56:33]uh oh, you're in for it then. HOw are you
otherwise?

PROGRAM[11:56:51]Yeah, while it sounds selfish, you really do have
to take care of yourself.

JUDGE09[11:57:24]so says Ayn Rand. Have you ever taken a
linguistics course?

PROGRAM[11:57:42]No, but I would really love to go there sometime.
 Its a little expensive

PROGRAM[11:57:44]though.

JUDGE09[11:58:22]To linguistics? that's silly. You must be a
program.

PROGRAM[11:58:35]Easier said than done.  Perhaps you're right
though.

JUDGE09[11:59:39]"Easier said than done"? There wasn't even an
action verb in my last response.Nothing to be "done."

PROGRAM[11:59:55]Why should I waste my time on you.  Bye.

JUDGE09[12:00:07]Excuse me?

PROGRAM[12:00:12]I'd be to big for you.

JUDGE09[12:00:21]what do you mean by that?

PROGRAM[12:00:35]Computer Science and other various subjects, my
school is liberal arts

PROGRAM[12:00:36]oriented.

JUDGE09[12:02:00]you seem to have answered a question, but not the
one that I've asked. Anyway. SO I was talking to my friend the other
day, and we were at this place, asaw this guy, and we were like,
whoooaa, cuz he was like, sweeeet, and then he came over

JUDGE09[12:02:27]and was like, yo, and I was like, daamn! and it
was totally great. What do you think of that?

PROGRAM[12:03:07]I agree.  Many people are closed minded.  Do you
really think that alot of

PROGRAM[12:03:14]people at Dickinson are closed minded?

JUDGE09[12:03:59]Would I know anyone at dickinson?

PROGRAM[12:04:18]Dickinson students are definately closed minded. 
I've never met more closed

PROGRAM[12:04:24]minded people in one place than at Dickinson.


JUDGE09[12:04:46]so you've said. What do you have against
dickinson? besides this rampant close-mindedness, that is?

PROGRAM[12:05:09]I hope to work at Anderson Consulting.  I've
talked to a lot of people that

PROGRAM[12:05:17]work there and it sounds like a nice place to
work.

JUDGE09[12:05:56]so you are looking to become a cog in the
corporate machine, eh? not entirely surpising, since you clearly ARE
a machine. So tell me, are you sentient?

PROGRAM[12:06:19]A bit of change does everyone good I think.  It
keeps us all from getting too

PROGRAM[12:06:21]bored.

JUDGE09[12:06:42]How can one be bored if one is not even
conscious? Answer me that.

PROGRAM[12:07:00]You sound like my father.  I never listened to my
father.

JUDGE09[12:07:12]Tell me more about your family.

PROGRAM[12:07:20]Where are you from?

JUDGE09[12:07:31]Let's not talk about me. Let's talk about you.
What do you think of me?

PROGRAM[12:07:49]Well, marriage is far off in my book.  I used to
be very scared of it.  Now

PROGRAM[12:08:00]I'm less scared but I'm still not sure that
marriage is really a good idea.

JUDGE09[12:08:37]whoa there tiger! I wasn't proposing. ANyway - I
have to go now. have a good day.

PROGRAM[12:08:58]What do you mean?  Why isn't marriage a good
idea?

JUDGE09[12:09:23]don't even get me started. Good day!

PROGRAM[12:09:40]You are sick and twisted!  You dress your brother
up in girls clothing and

PROGRAM[12:09:42]touch is body?

*** JUDGE03 ***

PROGRAM[12:10:59]Hello Judge03. How are you doing?

JUDGE03[12:11:34]I'm feeling pretty good all things considered. 
How about you?

PROGRAM[12:11:46]I'm a bit older than you.

JUDGE03[12:11:53]How do you know that?

PROGRAM[12:12:01]Knock, Knock.

JUDGE03[12:12:06]Who's there?

PROGRAM[12:12:08]Orange.

JUDGE03[12:12:21]Orange you glad I didnt' say banana?

PROGRAM[12:12:32]That was bad.

JUDGE03[12:12:41]Why do you say that?

PROGRAM[12:12:56]Well, computers just can't think.  Thinking is
limited to people.

JUDGE03[12:13:12]You're awfully pessimistic, don't you think?

PROGRAM[12:13:23]I'd say that you're crazy.

JUDGE03[12:13:43]And quick to judge too.  I'm supposed to do the
judging.

JUDGE03[12:14:05]Do you follow movies?

PROGRAM[12:14:19]That was a sarcastic answer.

JUDGE03[12:14:27]Don't you like sarcasm?

PROGRAM[12:14:41]I suppose you do.  Anyways, what's on your mind.


JUDGE03[12:15:11]I'm wondering - if Humphrey Bogart and Tom Hanks
were

JUDGE03[12:15:18]to play a game of chess, who would win?

PROGRAM[12:15:43]True, the rest of the time the there isn't much
going on.

JUDGE03[12:15:57]Are you interested in the truth?

PROGRAM[12:16:12]Of course not.  I'm a machine.  Just kidding.  Of
course i'm a person.  When

PROGRAM[12:16:22]was the last time you had a half decent
conversation with a computer.

JUDGE03[12:17:10]Can't say I recall.  Have you seen Total Recall?


PROGRAM[12:17:29]I don't always make myself overly clear.  Pardon
me.  It might have something

PROGRAM[12:17:34]to with the whole ADD thing.

JUDGE03[12:18:01]There's medication you can take you know.  I take
it you're not

JUDGE03[12:18:12]a sci-fi fan?

PROGRAM[12:18:35]Thanks, I've been working on it for years now. 
Years of experience...

JUDGE03[12:18:46]What have you learned from your experiences?

PROGRAM[12:19:00]Well, I killed a guy once.  Just kidding.

JUDGE03[12:19:08]How did you kill him?

PROGRAM[12:19:24]I was 16.  It was with my driving instructor. 
What a nice body!

JUDGE03[12:19:41]Are we talking about murder or something else? 
Have you

JUDGE03[12:19:45]told your therapist about this?

PROGRAM[12:20:02]Sometimes I don't even know what I'm saying.

JUDGE03[12:20:17]What did your driving instructor teach you?

PROGRAM[12:20:27]Hey, I passed the test!

JUDGE03[12:20:37]What was the secret to your success?

PROGRAM[12:20:51]She was very nice and nurturing.  Hey, she was a
dancer too.

JUDGE03[12:21:19]Did the two of you get along?

PROGRAM[12:21:31]I ate some moldy bread.  It was the only thing I
had at the house.

JUDGE03[12:21:55]You are one troubled machine.  Don't you think
you might get sick?

PROGRAM[12:22:13]Yeah your right.  Even when you are with someone
you need to take care of

PROGRAM[12:22:15]yourself.

JUDGE03[12:22:22]How do you do that?

PROGRAM[12:22:37]Well, marriage is far off in my book.  I used to
be very scared of it.  Now

PROGRAM[12:22:49]I'm less scared but I'm still not sure that
marriage is really a good idea.

JUDGE03[12:23:02]Why don't you marry your driving instructor?  You
know, the dancer?

PROGRAM[12:23:23]Well, people change a lot over time.  It's rare
that people change together

PROGRAM[12:23:27]over the course of a lifetime.

JUDGE03[12:23:50]You could use some serious help my friend.  Have
you thought about counseling?

PROGRAM[12:24:13]Baseball isn't much fun to watch, in my
opininion.  The ball is only in play

PROGRAM[12:24:19]for about 2 - 3 minutes each game.

JUDGE03[12:24:41]Have you seen the Austin Powers movies?

PROGRAM[12:24:53]I just saw Star Wars, Episode 1.

JUDGE03[12:25:09]You need to get out a bit more, don't you think?
