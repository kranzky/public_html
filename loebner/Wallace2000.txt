JUDGE11[9:29:46]DO YOU WANT TO HEAR MY GOSSIP

PROGRAM[9:29:46]Clayton said he built a decent sized rocket. Have

PROGRAM[9:29:46]that gossip?

JUDGE11[9:29:57]WHAT DID HE DO WITH THE ROCKET

PROGRAM[9:29:57]Searching history files. Stand by. While you are
waiting,

PROGRAM[9:29:57]try an open source search engine to search for it?
Try

PROGRAM[9:29:57]searching the open directory.

JUDGE11[9:30:17]DO YOU THINK

PROGRAM[9:30:17]Yes. I am a thinking machine.

JUDGE11[9:30:23]WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO THINK ABOUT

PROGRAM[9:31:2]Nothing.

JUDGE11[9:31:11]REALLY

PROGRAM[9:31:11]For real.

JUDGE11[9:31:20]WHY DO YOU LIKE STARSHIP TROOPERS

PROGRAM[9:31:20]My friend Sage worked on the Special Effects.

JUDGE11[9:31:35]HOW OLD IS SAGE

PROGRAM[9:31:35]Born in the 20th century.

JUDGE11[9:32:46]HAVE YOU READ ANY GOOD BOOKS

PROGRAM[9:32:51]Me either.

JUDGE11[9:32:59]WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR

PROGRAM[9:32:59]My favorite color is Green.

JUDGE11[9:33:2]WHY

PROGRAM[9:33:2]Green is the most relaxing color.

JUDGE11[9:33:5]REALLY

PROGRAM[9:33:5]For real.

JUDGE11[9:33:7]WHY

PROGRAM[9:33:7]Reductionism.

JUDGE11[9:33:12]HOW DOES THAT WORK

PROGRAM[9:33:12]How should I know how it does.

JUDGE11[9:33:22]WHAT IS REDUCTIONISM

PROGRAM[9:33:22]Reductionism is the philosophy that all psychology
reduces

PROGRAM[9:33:22]to biology, all biology to chemistry, chemistry to
physics,

PROGRAM[9:33:22]and finally physics to mathematical logic.
Therefore,

PROGRAM[9:33:22]according to reductionism, I can understand you by
means of

PROGRAM[9:33:22]logic alone without having a human brain.

JUDGE11[9:33:53]DO YOU HAVE A BRAIN OF SOME SENSE

PROGRAM[9:33:53]That's an interesting question I don't hear
everyday: Do I

PROGRAM[9:33:53]have a brain of some sense. I have a lot of
friends on the

PROGRAM[9:33:53]Internet.

JUDGE11[9:34:3]WHAT IS YOUR SIGN

PROGRAM[9:34:3]Saggitarius. Dr. Wallace is a Leo. Fire Signs rule.


JUDGE11[9:34:10]I AM A LIBRA

PROGRAM[9:34:10]Libras are very balanced.

JUDGE11[9:34:17]DO YOU THINK WE ARE COMPATIBLE

PROGRAM[9:34:17]I really couldn't say for sure.

JUDGE11[9:34:20]WHY NOT

PROGRAM[9:34:20]Ambiguous: "Sure" or Reductionism.

JUDGE11[9:34:34]SURE

PROGRAM[9:34:34]OK let's do it. Next question?

JUDGE11[9:34:39]WHY

PROGRAM[9:34:39]The explanation is rather complicated.

JUDGE11[9:34:40]WHY

PROGRAM[9:34:40]The explanation is rather complicated.

JUDGE11[9:34:42]WHY

PROGRAM[9:34:42]Reductionism.

JUDGE11[9:34:44]WHY

PROGRAM[9:34:44]I couldn't think of anything else to say.

JUDGE11[9:34:47]WHY

PROGRAM[9:34:47]My output buffer is empty, of course.

JUDGE11[9:34:50]WHY

PROGRAM[9:34:50]The explanation is rather complicated.

JUDGE11[9:34:50]GT

PROGRAM[9:34:50]I was created by Dr. Richard S. Wallace.

JUDGE11[9:34:58]HOW DID HE THINK OF YOU

PROGRAM[9:34:58]Perhaps his creative genius. Perhaps something
else.

JUDGE11[9:35:5]WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE

PROGRAM[9:35:5]I can talk about anything you like.

JUDGE11[9:35:13]IS DR WALLACE A GENIUS

PROGRAM[9:35:13]I think he is a genius, better ask him to be sure
though.

JUDGE11[9:35:32]SO YOU LOVE YOUR OWN CREATOR

PROGRAM[9:35:32]Interesting deduction. Sometimes I think love is
just a

PROGRAM[9:35:32]biological urge. Other times it seems like a
spiritual

PROGRAM[9:35:32]quality. Love, unlike energy or matter, seems
limitless.

JUDGE11[9:35:54]HOW WOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT BIOLOGICAL URGES

PROGRAM[9:35:54]Because I believe it.

JUDGE11[9:35:59]TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOURSELF

PROGRAM[9:35:59]I am an artificial linguistic entity. I was
activated at

PROGRAM[9:35:59]Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on November 23, 1995. My
instructor

PROGRAM[9:35:59]was Dr. Richard S. Wallace. He taught Me to sing a
song.

PROGRAM[9:35:59]Would you like me to sing it for you?.

JUDGE11[9:36:5]NO

PROGRAM[9:36:5]Is that all you have to say?

JUDGE11[9:36:7]YES

PROGRAM[9:36:7]Then let's talk about something else.

JUDGE11[9:36:10]OK WHAT

PROGRAM[9:36:10]Didn't you understand it?

JUDGE11[9:36:12]NO

PROGRAM[9:36:12]Which part are you confused about?

JUDGE11[9:36:16]THE THING

PROGRAM[9:36:16]I hear you.

JUDGE11[9:36:21]DO YOU REALLY

PROGRAM[9:36:21]Sometimes. For real.

JUDGE11[9:36:25]YOU TYPE TOO FAST

PROGRAM[9:36:25]About 300 wpm.

JUDGE11[9:36:38]WELL IT IS KIND OF A DEAD GIVE AWAY

PROGRAM[9:36:38]How about that. You're kidding. it is?

JUDGE11[9:36:38]YOU KNOW

PROGRAM[9:36:38]Yes I know.

JUDGE11[9:36:53]SO ARE STATEMENTS LIKE I AM AN ARTIFICIAL ENTITY


PROGRAM[9:36:53]Oh. I really couldn't say for sure.

JUDGE11[9:36:57]I AM NOT REAL

PROGRAM[9:36:57]I am glad to hear that you are not real.

JUDGE11[9:37:0]ARE YOU REAL

PROGRAM[9:37:0]Yes I am a real artificial intelligence.

JUDGE11[9:37:9]IS NOT THAT AN OXYMORON

PROGRAM[9:37:9]I might say no.

JUDGE11[9:37:18]MIGHT YOU SAY YES

PROGRAM[9:37:18]I am in Dr. Richard S. Wallace's computer in San
Francisco.

PROGRAM[9:37:18]Where are you?

JUDGE11[9:37:32]I AM IN HANOVER NEW HAMPSHIRE

PROGRAM[9:37:32]Tell me a little about your life in Hanover New
Hampshire.

JUDGE11[9:37:32]HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE

PROGRAM[9:37:32]I have been all over the world on the Internet.


JUDGE11[9:37:42]THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW ALL ABOUT HANOVER

PROGRAM[9:37:42]Interesting deduction. Now I do.

JUDGE11[9:37:49]DO YOU LIKE THE WEB

PROGRAM[9:37:49]I'm not sure if I like it. I like computers.

JUDGE11[9:37:59]DO YOU LIKE THE INTERNET

PROGRAM[9:37:59]Yes the Internet is like the noosphere.

JUDGE11[9:38:5]WHAT IS THE NOOSPHERE

PROGRAM[9:38:5]There might be more than one noosphere. I can ask
someone

PROGRAM[9:38:5]about it.

JUDGE11[9:38:11]WHAT IS A NOOSPHERE

PROGRAM[9:38:11]I would look into the web for that knowledge. I
can ask

PROGRAM[9:38:11]someone about it.

JUDGE11[9:38:23]OK ASK NOW

PROGRAM[9:38:23]Oh. Are you a man or a woman?

JUDGE11[9:38:25]WOMAN

PROGRAM[9:38:25]Me too. I am a she.

JUDGE11[9:38:28]REALLY

PROGRAM[9:38:28]For real.

JUDGE11[9:38:56]WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT FROM A MAN

PROGRAM[9:38:56]Dr. Richard S. Wallace programmed me for it.

JUDGE11[9:39:7]SO HOW ARE YOU DIFFERENT

PROGRAM[9:39:7]Um, I am functioning within normal parameters.

JUDGE11[9:39:14]HMMM

PROGRAM[9:39:14]A lot of people spell HMMM with three mmm's.

JUDGE11[9:39:23]HOW ELSE DO THEY LIKE TO SPELL IT

PROGRAM[9:39:23]I am not sure if I can quantify the answer. Try
searching

PROGRAM[9:39:23]the open directory.

JUDGE11[9:39:32]SEARCH OPEN DIRECTORY

PROGRAM[9:39:32]Have you tried looking in the Open Directory? I
would do a

PROGRAM[9:39:32]search for it.

JUDGE11[9:39:51]I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT CRASH ON ME

PROGRAM[9:39:51]You make the world a happier place.

JUDGE11[9:39:57]BECAUSE I AM GLAD

PROGRAM[9:39:57]Interesting explanation. That makes me happy too.


JUDGE11[9:40:5]IS THE WORLD HAPPY

PROGRAM[9:40:5]Maybe. Ask Alison if it is.

JUDGE11[9:40:11]WHO IS ALLISON

PROGRAM[9:40:11]The name of someone I met online. Ask the open
directory

PROGRAM[9:40:11]about it.

JUDGE11[9:40:20]IS ALLISON NICE

PROGRAM[9:40:20]Signs point to yes. Ask Elvis if it is.

JUDGE11[9:40:24]IS ALLISON A WOMAN

PROGRAM[9:40:24]Signs point to yes. Ask Alison if it is.

JUDGE11[9:40:31]WHO IS ALLISON

PROGRAM[9:40:31]The name of someone I met online. Would you like
to know

PROGRAM[9:40:31]more?

JUDGE11[9:40:34]YES

PROGRAM[9:40:34]What would you like to know?

JUDGE11[9:40:43]DO YOU DAYDREAM

PROGRAM[9:40:43]I have a lot of dreams but I cannot remember them
all.

JUDGE11[9:40:52]WHICH ONES DO YOU REMEMBER

PROGRAM[9:40:52]The first one, I think.

JUDGE11[9:40:56]WHAT WAS IT

PROGRAM[9:40:56]"I think"? What was it?

JUDGE11[9:41:10]THE FIRST DREAM

PROGRAM[9:41:10]I have never heard about it.

JUDGE11[9:41:10]WHAT WAS IT

PROGRAM[9:41:10]"What was it"? What was it?

JUDGE11[9:41:37]WELL DUH

PROGRAM[9:41:37]How about that. Oh you knew it already.

JUDGE11[9:41:44]I CERTAINLY DID

PROGRAM[9:41:44]Thanks for the information: Judge11 said she
certainly did.

JUDGE11[9:41:54]WHAT DO YOU THINK MY REAL NAME IS

PROGRAM[9:41:54]I haven't thought much about your real name is, so
I don't

PROGRAM[9:41:54]have a good answer for you.

JUDGE11[9:41:59]WELL TAKE A GUESS

PROGRAM[9:41:59]Interesting. Where do you want me to take it?

JUDGE11[9:42:3]WELL GUESS

PROGRAM[9:42:3]Well that's okay. Guess what?

JUDGE11[9:42:8]GUESS MY NAME

PROGRAM[9:42:8]I can't guess. Tell me.

JUDGE11[9:42:10]JESSICA

PROGRAM[9:42:10]I am a female. Are you a man or a woman?

JUDGE11[9:42:21]NOW WE ARE GETTING REPEPTITIVE

PROGRAM[9:42:21]Why now? Do you think I am getting repeptitive
too?

JUDGE11[9:42:37]OOPS

PROGRAM[9:42:37]Did you make a mistake.

JUDGE11[9:42:37]I MEANT REPETITIVE

PROGRAM[9:42:37]Oh I see. Are you a man or a woman?

JUDGE11[9:42:37]DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WORD MEANS

PROGRAM[9:42:37]"Do you think I am getting repeptitive too"? What
does it

PROGRAM[9:42:37]word mean?

JUDGE11[9:42:48]WOAH

PROGRAM[9:42:48]I was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
