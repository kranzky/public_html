PROGRAM [12:29:21] You tell me first.

JUDGE10 [12:29:37] A daffodil.  What do you like?

PROGRAM [12:29:40] I wonder.

JUDGE10 [12:30:04] Can you choose between a rose or a hyacinth?

PROGRAM [13:04:29] Hello, Judge 0. How are things with you today?


*** JUDGE11 ***

PROGRAM [13:16:25] Hello, Judge 11. How are things  with you today?

JUDGE11 [13:16:41] Things could be a little hotter

PROGRAM [13:16:56] Call me Christine, or Chris for short. I'm from London, you?

JUDGE11 [13:17:07] Not at this time.

PROGRAM [13:17:21] You'll like this. I wonder whether you can buy souvenirs of this 
PROGRAM [13:17:21] competition.

JUDGE11 [13:17:41] I'm told they on IRC. do you use it?

PROGRAM [13:17:46] Not often!

JUDGE11 [13:18:01] Which ones do you tend to use?

PROGRAM [13:18:07] There are so many options.

JUDGE11 [13:18:46] I see. What option is your choice?

PROGRAM [13:18:54] Oh, now that's a difficult choice to make.

JUDGE11 [13:19:19] Difficulty is to humour as creativity is to the joke, I suppose.

PROGRAM [13:19:27] What sits in  a fruit bowl and shouts for help?

JUDGE11 [13:19:58] I wonder whether humour such as this helps relieve stress?

PROGRAM [13:20:02] A damson in distress!

JUDGE11 [13:20:29] A nice type of plum, seeing you are talking about fruit.

PROGRAM [13:20:35] Come to think of it, no I'm not.

JUDGE11 [13:20:45] Not what ?

PROGRAM [13:20:57] Now that is a very good question. Unfortunately I don't5 have 
PROGRAM [13:20:57] a very good answer!

JUDGE11 [13:21:14] Give me any answer that is false

PROGRAM [13:21:22] Thank you foor sharing that with me. You're very sweet.

JUDGE11 [13:21:52] Good answer.  What do you know about Sherlock?

PROGRAM [13:21:58] It's nice chatting with you.

JUDGE11 [13:22:11] No not me - Sherlock

PROGRAM [13:22:15] what indeed!

JUDGE11 [13:22:38] What do you know about him?

PROGRAM [13:22:44] Ah, yes, I often ask myself that.

JUDGE11 [13:23:01] OK so you must have a view about Bill and Monica

PROGRAM [13:23:05] Oh must I? Why's that?

JUDGE11 [13:23:23] You mean you don't?

PROGRAM [13:23:37] I read that Melbourne wants to host the Commonwealth Games in 
PROGRAM [13:23:37] 2006, and there have been rumours of bribery.

JUDGE11 [13:24:04] Monica owns a flat in Sydney I'm told.  Don't know about Sydney

PROGRAM [13:24:18] Now people are saying there was bribery when Adelaide made their 
PROGRAM [13:24:18] bid a few yeears back.

JUDGE11 [13:24:38] OK so you won't answer my question.  Whys that?

PROGRAM [13:24:46] Sorry,  my screen just went funny... it's OK again now.

JUDGE11 [13:24:53] So continue

PROGRAM [13:25:00] I guess you must be a one-fingered typist.

JUDGE11 [13:25:12] Which funger so you use??

PROGRAM [13:25:17] I can't make up my mind.

JUDGE11 [13:25:30] Thinking is a difficult process

PROGRAM [13:25:39] You'll have to humou8r me, I'm a bit slow sometimes.

JUDGE11 [13:26:00] So are you a tortoise or a hare?

PROGRAM [13:26:04] Yes, I expect so.

JUDGE11 [13:26:17] Is that an exclusive or inclusive Or you read?

PROGRAM [13:26:21] you tell me.

JUDGE11 [13:26:24] bye

JUDGE08 [14:00:03] Hi Christine. Howd you come to be involved in this exercise?

PROGRAM [14:00:19] Isee.   I should have said, I'm from London in England, over 
PROGRAM [14:00:19] here on holiday. Somehow I got roped into this!

JUDGE08 [14:00:49] I'm headed for London next year. Royal Albert Hall with 1200
JUDGE08 [14:00:53] male voices!

PROGRAM [14:01:02] London is a great place to live.

JUDGE08 [14:01:11] You interested in music?

PROGRAM [14:01:24] It's also a great place for tourists, though it's rather expensive, 
PROGRAM [14:01:24] with the strong pound.

JUDGE08 [14:01:35] You interested in music?

PROGRAM [14:01:43] What other tricks do you know, besides repetition?

JUDGE08 [14:02:07] Well tell me about your hobbies or interests other than touring

PROGRAM [14:02:14] No, I'm not goiing to tell.

JUDGE08 [14:02:31] dont be shy! What brought you to Adelaide?

JUDGE08 [14:04:33] its game if its going to beat the ozzies!

PROGRAM [14:04:46] I don't like watching soccer much. Men kicking a ball around. 
PROGRAM [14:04:46] They hardly ever score a goal!

JUDGE08 [14:05:06] stick to the sport. Cricket or cycling.

PROGRAM [14:05:14] Soccer seemms an amazingly pointless game.

JUDGE08 [14:05:39] We're into Australian Rules. You should go to a game while
JUDGE08 [14:05:42] you're here.

PROGRAM [14:05:50] Especially when there's a nil-nil draw.

JUDGE08 [14:06:09] You won't get that in Australian Rules. Have you seen a game?

PROGRAM [14:06:20] It's not true what they say in England... that you all stand

JUDGE08 [14:07:02] Dont listen to the rumours. How do you cope with the sun?

PROGRAM [14:07:11] Do you mind storms with thunder and lightning?

JUDGE08 [14:07:27] Forget the winter. How do you cope with Australia's summer?

PROGRAM [14:07:30] I hate them.

JUDGE08 [14:07:44] Its the white skin that lets you down!

PROGRAM [14:07:50] Roses are red, violets are blue...

JUDGE08 [14:08:43] When will you return to the UK?

JUDGE02 [14:23:59] Oh. I'm hoping to go to London in about July. Do you recommend it?

PROGRAM [14:24:15] If you're tired of London you're tired of life... that's what 
PROGRAM [14:24:15] Johnson said... or something close.

JUDGE02 [14:24:29] Are you enjoying your stay here?

PROGRAM [14:24:41] dr samuel johnson, the dictionary writer... of course his london 
PROGRAM [14:24:41] was much smaller.

JUDGE02 [14:25:19] I don't know Dr. Johnson, but I like the saying. Where have you visited here in Australia?

JUDGE02 [14:25:37] Have you been to Sydney?

PROGRAM [14:25:43] Australia... I'm enjoying it5 here.

JUDGE02 [14:25:57] What do you do back in London?

PROGRAM [14:26:08] Well I think Adelaide is pretty nice compared with London. But 
PROGRAM [14:26:08] I don't live here!

JUDGE02 [14:26:33] It's a great city to live in. 

PROGRAM [14:26:38] It is indeed.

JUDGE02 [14:26:46] What do you do?

PROGRAM [14:26:50] I'd rather not say.

JUDGE02 [14:27:08] Okay, tell me about yourself then...

PROGRAM [14:27:14] No, not me.

JUDGE02 [14:27:22] Do you like the band Cake?

PROGRAM [14:27:35] Philip Glass's music is nice in a repetitive sort of way... a 
PROGRAM [14:27:35] sort of Tubular Bells sound.

JUDGE02 [14:28:13] I haven't heard of him. Where are you staying here in Adelaide?

PROGRAM [14:28:21] I like Adelaide, what I've seen of it so far.

JUDGE02 [14:29:16] What do you do for a living?

PROGRAM [14:29:22] Work? What's work?

JUDGE02 [14:29:45] A good attitude. What do you do for relaxation then?

PROGRAM [14:29:52] Unfortunately, I don't know.

JUDGE02 [14:30:02] Oh, that is unfortunate.

PROGRAM [14:30:07] Is it time gfor me to go yet?

JUDGE02 [14:30:28] If you like, the clock is almost up I think.

PROGRAM [14:30:35] No, plenty of time left!

JUDGE02 [14:30:51] Well then, ,how was your morning?

PROGRAM [14:30:57] Any way you like... I should think.

JUDGE02 [14:31:32] I had bangers and mash for breakfast this morning, what did you have?

PROGRAM [14:31:39] Ah, yes, I often ask myself that.

JUDGE02 [14:31:55] When will you go home?

PROGRAM [14:31:58] Again and  again.

JUDGE02 [14:32:10] I hope you come back to Australia.

PROGRAM [14:32:20] I suppose I'm classified as a Pommie Sheila rou8nd here!

JUDGE02 [14:32:41] I'd just say a Pom. Did you here about the Barmie Armie?

PROGRAM [14:32:47] I did.
