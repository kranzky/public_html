PROGRAM[10:07:12]Hi, my name is Catherine, what's yours?
PROGRAM[10:07:23].
JUDGE05[10:07:29]I'm Jurgen.
PROGRAM[10:07:31]Well, it's nice to meet you, Jurgen.
PROGRAM[10:07:40]Did you see that story on CNN last night about the lesbian
PROGRAM[10:07:52]couple who came out at a White House party on Sunday?
JUDGE05[10:08:33]NO. I just came in yesterday. I'm still kind of jet-lagged.
PROGRAM[10:08:35]Ellen Degeneres was one of them - she was kissing her lover
PROGRAM[10:08:51]in front of Bill Clinton. Do you think he was very
PROGRAM[10:09:14]embarrassed?
JUDGE05[10:10:18]I don't know? Don't you think it's a little childish if the leader of the most powerful nation on the planet is embarrassed by seeing two lesbians kiss?
PROGRAM[10:10:26]Probably! No. -
PROGRAM[10:10:29]Are you still a Friend of Bill Clinton?
JUDGE05[10:10:47]Never met him.
PROGRAM[10:10:48]You really don't like the guy--well, at least that's
PROGRAM[10:11:01]definite--I thought most people were just indifferent or
PROGRAM[10:11:14]numb by now.
JUDGE05[10:11:35]Have you seen the movie Mars attacs?
PROGRAM[10:11:36]Give me a break -- I'm just here to answer dumb questions
PROGRAM[10:11:50]-- not that! What were we talking about... Ok.. I guess that
PROGRAM[10:12:09]means you really think there's serious behind Whitewater,
PROGRAM[10:12:29]the Special prosecutor and all that stuff?
JUDGE05[10:12:48]I'm cold.
PROGRAM[10:12:49]But how do you actually feel about him, now in the number
PROGRAM[10:13:01]two term?
PROGRAM[10:13:06].
JUDGE05[10:13:29]Hey, don't you get it? I don't want to talk about Clinton.
PROGRAM[10:13:30]Sorry--my attention slipped for a moment--can we pushon to
PROGRAM[10:13:40]something more gripping. where was I.. oh yes OK, but what
PROGRAM[10:13:50]happens now--does it all drift on, with everyone waiting to
PROGRAM[10:13:58]see how much his friends have said about him under threat of
PROGRAM[10:14:07]lots and lots of jail-or will something dramatic actually
PROGRAM[10:14:17]happen?
PROGRAM[10:14:19].
JUDGE05[10:14:37]Couldn't care less.
PROGRAM[10:14:38]Well, you’re more concerned about him that I am, I
PROGRAM[10:14:53]suppose--I think we've had worse, and who knows what I might
PROGRAM[10:15:07]have agreed to in that locked hotel room.
JUDGE05[10:15:53]You mean you might have been thrilled to have sex with the
President?
PROGRAM[10:15:56]sex, I knew it would come up sooner or later. Time to get
PROGRAM[10:16:10]off this one I think and onto something more down to earth!
JUDGE05[10:16:40]What kind of earth?
PROGRAM[10:16:41]Somebody once told me it's true. Like I was saying
PROGRAM[10:16:54]I suppose it depends on where you're coming from, but as the
PROGRAM[10:17:09]song goes in My Fair Lady, "Why can't a woman be more like a

JUDGE04[10:18:32]My name is Elliott.
PROGRAM[10:18:34]Well, it's nice to meet you, Elliott.
PROGRAM[10:18:48]Did you see that story on CNN last night about the lesbian
PROGRAM[10:19:04]couple who came out at a White House party on Sunday?
JUDGE04[10:19:55]Yes, I did.  I think it may all be a publicity stunt for Ellen.
PROGRAM[10:20:01]Ellen Degeneres was one of them - she was kissing her lover
PROGRAM[10:20:11]in front of Bill Clinton. Do you think he was very
PROGRAM[10:20:25]embarrassed?
JUDGE04[10:21:00]I think he want the gay vote.  He will do anything to get it and keep it.
JUDGE04[10:21:15]He does not have a conservative base.
PROGRAM[10:21:21]
PROGRAM[10:21:21]Are you still a Friend of Bill Clinton?
JUDGE04[10:22:20]I am not sure if he has any real friends.  He has achieved alot and has
JUDGE04[10:22:31]left alot of people behind.
PROGRAM[10:22:35]You really don't like the guy--well, at least that's
PROGRAM[10:22:50]definite--I thought most people were just indifferent or
PROGRAM[10:23:02]numb by now.
JUDGE04[10:23:34]I think we could have a more honest and dynamic leader. One able to
JUDGE04[10:23:55]face the real dangers facing the country and address them with
JUDGE04[10:24:26]courage and intelligence.  Rather then listening to public opinion polls.
PROGRAM[10:24:30]I guess that means you really think there's serious behind
PROGRAM[10:24:56]Whitewater, the Special prosecutor and all that stuff?
JUDGE04[10:25:58]We have two dead people, Brown and guy who commited suicide,  we have lost
JUDGE04[10:26:36]papers. And we have Clintons people willing to tell all. I think that
JUDGE04[10:26:55]Hillary will be found guilty of something.
PROGRAM[10:26:58]But how do you actually feel about him, now in the number
PROGRAM[10:27:09]two term?
PROGRAM[10:27:15].
JUDGE04[10:27:44]He is too smart to get caught.  He deserved to named hotel manager of the
JUDGE04[10:27:47]year.
PROGRAM[10:27:49]OK, but what happens now--does it all drift on, with

JUDGE03[10:30:01]No... Are you serious? Who?
PROGRAM[10:30:03]I'm pretty much that way today. No idea who, do you? Hm, i

PROGRAM[10:30:36]kissing her lover in front of Bill Clinton. Do you think he
PROGRAM[10:30:54]was very embarrassed?
JUDGE03[10:31:14]I doubt it very much. From what I've heard, Bill's been, done and seen
JUDGE03[10:31:25]just about everything there is for a consenting adult to see.

JUDGE03[10:33:27]The problems of the Clitnots bore me. May I suggest that we talk about something

PROGRAM[10:33:34]Yes. What I was saying was... But how do you actually feel
PROGRAM[10:33:46]about him, now in the number two term?
PROGRAM[10:34:00].
JUDGE03[10:34:29]Okay. I see you're a bit preoccupied. I think he's a competent politician. I
JUDGE03[10:34:48]have no real complaints -- he hasn't done anything outrageous. He's a bit
JUDGE03[10:34:58]fluffy at times, but what do you expect in this day and age?
PROGRAM[10:35:01]Well, I suppose he's doing his best like most of us, but he

JUDGE03[10:36:03]Your creator must live in DC. I have news for you. The rest of the country -- the rest of

JUDGE01[10:52:08]I doubt much embarasses Clinton.

PROGRAM[10:52:09]Are you still a Friend of Bill Clinton?
JUDGE01[10:52:42]I never really was a FOB. I voted for him, but as the lesser of two evils.

PROGRAM[10:52:57]definite--I thought most people were just indifferent or
PROGRAM[10:53:07]numb by now.
JUDGE01[10:53:25]Thats probably about right. I think that Watergate had the
JUDGE01[10:53:46]effect of numbing people to a lot of lesser political scandals.
PROGRAM[10:53:47]I guess that means you really think there's serious behind

JUDGE01[10:54:24]serious what?

JUDGE01[10:57:27]it seems like a war of attrition to me - i doubt there's a smoking
JUDGE01[10:57:52]gun, but the weight of stonewalling will probably damage his second
JUDGE01[10:57:56]term in the end.
PROGRAM[10:57:58]I find violence very disturbing. Well, you’re more

JUDGE01[11:29:10]The first one is, "When were you born?"
PROGRAM[11:29:15]Hi again!
PROGRAM[11:29:20]Clay have you ever been burgled.......?
JUDGE01[11:29:38]Yes, but I can't talk about that now.
JUDGE01[11:29:43]When were you born?
PROGRAM[11:29:45]I was born on Oct 27, 1970. - How long ago was that?
JUDGE01[11:30:04].
JUDGE01[11:30:13]It was 27 years ago.
JUDGE01[11:30:17]Whats your sign?
PROGRAM[11:30:20]Scorpio.... I imagine that was pretty awful.
JUDGE01[11:30:47]Last question: When you got your first liscence, was it in a stick or
JUDGE01[11:30:54]an automatic?
PROGRAM[11:30:56]Somebody once told me it's true.. My friend came home from
PROGRAM[11:31:16]work and disturbed a burglar. He had lined up two expensive
PROGRAM[11:31:31]guitars, and computer equipment to take and left them---she
PROGRAM[11:31:42]was real lucky, wouldnt you say?
JUDGE01[11:32:09]When you got your first liscence, was it in a stick or an automatic?

JUDGE01[11:32:37]No, I don't drive. Do you drive?
PROGRAM[11:32:38]OK, yes on balance. - Has real violent crime affected you
PROGRAM[11:32:50]in in another way?
JUDGE01[11:33:06]Oh yes, I have been held up at gunpoint.
PROGRAM[11:33:07]Was anyone charged with it in court?
JUDGE01[11:33:23]Nope.
PROGRAM[11:33:24]So often theres no psycholgically satisfactory conclusion.
PROGRAM[11:33:38]Did you feel violated by all this, or not?
