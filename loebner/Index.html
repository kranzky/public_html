<P>The <B>Loebner Contest</B> is version of the
Turing Test
which is held annually, and is open to anyone who cares to write a
conversation simulator.  The rules of the Loebner Contest can be found
on the

<H2>The 1996 Loebner Contest</H2>

<P>Rather suprisingly, my HeX program has won the 1996 Loebner contest,
beating four other computer entries.  The results are as below (you can read
the transcripts of each program by clicking on the name of their author):</P>

<H2>The 1997 Loebner Contest</H2>

<P>The standard of Loebner Contest entries rose in 1997.  The SEPO program didn't
win, and since SEPO is a big improvement over HeX, I take that as a good sign
for the future of the competition.</P>

<P>On second thoughts, having now taken a look at the transcripts I can see that
the winning program was very clever because it's opening gambit was to ask
the judges about something which had been in the news recently (the night
before the contest, in fact).  I personally feel that SEPO's conversation
was more realistic, and that the judges were swayed to choosing David's entry
because it could handle conversation about a recent news item rather well.
I'm not disparaging his work at all, I just feel that this was the deciding
factor, and I find that rather interesting.</P>

<P>The results of the 1997 contest are:</P>

<H2>The 1998 Loebner Contest</H2>

<P>In 1998, the Loebner Contest was held outside of the USA for the first time
in its history.  In fact, it was held in Australia, so I was able to attend
in person.  Four human beings and six computer programs made up the
confederates.  Ten judges had twelve minutes to chat to each of the
confederates and rank them from most human to least human.</P>

<P>Rather surprisingly, MegaHAL was ranked as the second most human computer
program.  I entered the contest expecting it to come last, as it uses a
technique quite different from normal conversation simulators.</P>

<P>The results of the 1998 contest are:</P>

<H2>The 1999 Loebner Contest</H2>

<P>The Loebner Contest was once again held in Australia in 1999, this time in
the "sleepy town" of Adelaide.  Once again I attended in person.  NonI,
the program I entered, came a disappointing fourth, which I put down to a
lack of training on my part.  The program needed to be trained from scratch:
it learnt everything during this period, including how to simulate typing.
I just didn't put in enough of an effort.</P>

<H2>The 2000 Loebner Contest</H2>

<P>I was <I>livid</I> when I saw the results for the 2000 Loebner Contest,
which was held at Dartmouth College, the site of the famous summer workshop
which initiated the field of Artificial Intelligence.  My submission,
eBrain (an improved version of SEPO) came second.  However, the contest
organisers deemed to use data files which I'd submitted several months
before the contest, instead of the ones I'd submitted just before the contest,
on the grounds that they hadn't had time to test them!  The result is that
my 2000 entry rather embarassingly resembles my 1997 entry, although that
was <I>not</I> intended to be the case.  Rather, I'd submitted the 1997
data files so the new executable could be tested by the organisers while
new data files, which make use of the new eBrain features, were being
developed.</P>

<P>The results of the 2000 contest are:</P>
