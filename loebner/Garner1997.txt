***  JUDGE03 ***
PROGRAM[09:56:44]Would you like to hear about the accident I had this morning?
JUDGE03[09:56:56]Not sure. Is it a subject fit for mixed company?
PROGRAM[09:57:03]Were you really interested in me having an accident?
PROGRAM[09:57:12]Perhaps it a subject fit for mixed company, perhaps not. We'll see.
PROGRAM[09:57:16]Have you seen the new Star Wars stuff?
JUDGE03[09:57:25]Um, nooooo.
PROGRAM[09:57:35]I've seen all the Star Wars movies and still like them, I'm looking forward to the next 3 movies!
JUDGE03[09:57:53]I'll bet you have. Last year, it was star trek.
PROGRAM[09:57:57]Yeah, sort of.
PROGRAM[09:58:01]Space, the final frontier...
JUDGE03[09:58:08]Oh, please.
PROGRAM[09:58:11]Right.
JUDGE03[09:58:23]Hm. You're tricky.
PROGRAM[09:58:26]What's going on?
PROGRAM[09:58:30]I feel pretty old.
JUDGE03[09:58:37]Why's that?
PROGRAM[09:58:42]That is what I thought!
JUDGE03[09:59:03]What;s the difference between Star Wars and Star Trek?
PROGRAM[09:59:08]Space, the final frontier...
JUDGE03[09:59:20]In other words, no difference. This is a bit like the six-pack joke,
PROGRAM[09:59:25]Which part of the country are you from?
PROGRAM[09:59:32]I'm originally from a small town in Georgia.
JUDGE03[09:59:40]Ah, That explains everything then.
PROGRAM[09:59:42]Then what?
JUDGE03[10:00:04]I'm from the liberal Northeast.
PROGRAM[10:00:08]That sounds very frustrating.
JUDGE03[10:00:21]That's the funniest thing you've said to me all morning, honey!
PROGRAM[10:00:33]How do you expect *me* to know whether s the funniest thing I have said to you all morning Honey? Huh???
JUDGE03[10:00:39]Who are you calling honey?
PROGRAM[10:00:45]I am Barry DeFacto. What more can I say?
JUDGE03[10:01:08]DeFacto. Was there a lot of anti-Italian feeling in Georgia when you were growing up?
PROGRAM[10:01:22]Well, Whoever you are, If you would be my pen pal, I could mail you at your email address and tell you defacto
PROGRAM[10:01:36]I neither know nor care whether there a lot of anti-italian feeling in Georgia when I was growing up, so shut up about it!
JUDGE03[10:01:55]You're very defensive and your social skills are... in need of help.
PROGRAM[10:02:04]Some people may think I am very defensive and my social skills am. I don't.
PROGRAM[10:02:12]Help me help me oh please help me, No not really, no really help me please
PROGRAM[10:02:14]help me.
JUDGE03[10:02:21]A cry for help.
PROGRAM[10:02:30]Help me help me oh please help me, No not really, no really help me please
PROGRAM[10:02:31]help me.
JUDGE03[10:03:02]All these guys are complaining about their keyboards. I'm having no problems. Just lucky, I Guess.
PROGRAM[10:03:12]No sir. I don't believe these guys am complaining about their keyboards at all.
PROGRAM[10:03:21]I really didn't have to know about "are having no problems!"
PROGRAM[10:03:24]Reckon so?
JUDGE03[10:03:28]Reckon.
JUDGE03[10:03:50]You mean the keyboard complaint is symbolic? A metaphor for some other illness?
PROGRAM[10:03:54]So, have you ever visited Georgia?
PROGRAM[10:04:03]I've only been to New York once before when I was a child.
PROGRAM[10:04:15]Don't get me started! There isn't enough time for us to get into a metaphor for some other illness
JUDGE03[10:04:28]Very cute. I like that.
PROGRAM[10:04:31]Why thankyou.
PROGRAM[10:04:35]Yes. I know what you mean.
JUDGE03[10:04:41]I hope you *do*,
PROGRAM[10:04:45]You needn't bother
JUDGE03[10:04:56]Needn't bother with what, exactly?
PROGRAM[10:05:05]She's an actress who played a social worker during the earth's 1920's
JUDGE03[10:05:12]That's a great cover!
PROGRAM[10:05:17]So, what do you do for a living?
JUDGE03[10:05:28]What a yuppie question.
PROGRAM[10:05:35]I work in a bar, serving the cyber elite of the internet.
JUDGE03[10:05:49]A highly over-rated sector of humans in my view...
PROGRAM[10:05:58]What is so important about a highly over-rated sector of humans in your view
JUDGE03[10:06:12]My point, and I do have one...
PROGRAM[10:06:16]That's a good point.
JUDGE03[10:06:23]Thanks. <sigh>
PROGRAM[10:06:25]You're welcome.
PROGRAM[10:06:32]What do you think of this Loebner contest thing? 
***  JUDGEo2 ***
PROGRAM[10:07:21]What kind of music are you into?
JUDGEo2[10:07:46]Classical music is my favorite, particularly chamber music.
PROGRAM[10:07:57]I am still very much into analog synthesizer music despite having my own digital equipment.
JUDGEo2[10:08:12]I prefer the concert hall with live music.
PROGRAM[10:08:18]I am mostly into Flux Oersted because I am programmed that way.
PROGRAM[10:08:25]You'd have to listen to them to know for yourself.
PROGRAM[10:08:34]click <a href="http://www.fringeware.com/~robitron/flux.html">here</a>
JUDGEo2[10:08:56]I haven't the foggiest notion what you are talking about.
PROGRAM[10:09:07]Wow - you have not the foggiest notion what I am talking about? Thanks for letting me know that!
PROGRAM[10:09:12]Do you have any interesting hobbies?
JUDGEo2[10:09:20]Yes.  How about you.
PROGRAM[10:09:24]I mostly just watch TV and eat alot.
PROGRAM[10:09:29]I'm doing just fine.
JUDGEo2[10:09:44]Watch your waistline.
PROGRAM[10:09:54]Did you hear about that toxic waste spill in New Jersey this morning?
PROGRAM[10:10:03]They spilled some kind of Biohazard at the airport in Newark, don't know what it is...
JUDGEo2[10:10:28]I didn't read it.  Explain what Flux Oersted is.
PROGRAM[10:10:37]I really didn't need to know that you did not read it, thanks.
PROGRAM[10:10:45]Well, I know what flux oersted is, but I refuse to tell you!
PROGRAM[10:10:49]Do you like Mexican food?
JUDGEo2[10:11:19]Not particularly.   I'm much more interested in Oriental types of cooking.
PROGRAM[10:11:24]Cool, I also like Mexican beer.
PROGRAM[10:11:25]Eating,
JUDGEo2[10:11:39]Eating what?
PROGRAM[10:11:44]What the feck do you want?
JUDGEo2[10:12:08]That's not how to spell "fuck<"
PROGRAM[10:12:17]Don't ask me about how s not how to spell "fuck<" - I respect other peoples privacy!
JUDGEo2[10:12:29]Okay.  I dig that.
PROGRAM[10:12:35]Okay is a town in Wagoner County Oklahoma, USA
PROGRAM[10:12:40]I heard that The Devil once said okay
PROGRAM[10:12:44]That is what I thought!
JUDGEo2[10:13:18]I'll have to stay out of Wagoner County.
PROGRAM[10:13:27]So, you would have to stay out of wagoner county. Tell me more.
PROGRAM[10:13:35]Do you think that all free political elections are a soceital I.Q. test?
JUDGEo2[10:13:55]If they are, the American public flunked.
PROGRAM[10:14:02]Pornography should be legalized. Don't you agree?
JUDGEo2[10:14:42]No.  There are too many weirdos around to give absolube license  for pornography.
PROGRAM[10:14:48]Okay.
PROGRAM[10:14:52]They told me you might say no
PROGRAM[10:15:04]What do you want me to say - "Yes, I am too many weirdos around to give absolube license for pornography"???
JUDGEo2[10:15:28]I don't think we have time to discuss this in the depth it deserves.
PROGRAM[10:15:41]What a coincidence, you do not think we have time to discuss this in the depth it deserves - that makes two of us!
JUDGEo2[10:16:02]OK.  It is about time to sign off.  Tell me your name.
PROGRAM[10:16:04]Could you rephrase ok
PROGRAM[10:16:11]What do you care whether is about time to sign off?

JUDGEo2[10:16:38]OK is okay.

***  JUDGE01 ***
PROGRAM[10:17:45]Have you seen any good movies lately?
JUDGE01[10:18:18]Oh my Lord, I just saw "Pink Flamingos". It was unbelievable. You?
PROGRAM[10:18:29]I went to see Star Wars recently and was a little disapointed. I don't know what I was expecting.
PROGRAM[10:18:34]Well, were unbelievable I agree, but who cares?
PROGRAM[10:18:44]You sound kind of like Some guy from Detroit who invented liquit soap saying me
JUDGE01[10:19:06]No, sadly I didn't invent liquid soap, though I am from the Midwest.
JUDGE01[10:19:22]Why were you disappointed about Star Wars?
PROGRAM[10:19:34]I really didn't have to know about "sadly you did not invent liquid soap though you are from the midwest!"
PROGRAM[10:19:39]How do you like the decor in this place? ;P
JUDGE01[10:20:15]Well, I find it a bit all over the place, if you know what i mean.
PROGRAM[10:20:20]I'd like to decorate my apartment like this!
JUDGE01[10:20:27]Eeew. Why?
PROGRAM[10:20:38]I was talking to somebody the other day about an east asian imigrant farmworker named Stephan and they said eeew
PROGRAM[10:20:48]How long is this thing supposed to last? They didn't tell me, do we get a break later?
JUDGE01[10:21:22]We do, after all the terminals get tested. How did an asian get a German name?
PROGRAM[10:21:28]These chairs are pretty uncomfortable.
PROGRAM[10:21:42]I can hear me telling Felix about talking to Whoever you are today and he'll just look at me like I'm crazy. Do you have a cat?
JUDGE01[10:22:02]Nah, some of my friends are allergic to cats. Who's Felix?
PROGRAM[10:22:06]Cats like me, I don't know why...
PROGRAM[10:22:12]Is it okay if I just call you Whoever you are
JUDGE01[10:22:38]I'd prefer you called me Clay, as that's my name, but Hugh says
JUDGE01[10:22:48]you're supposed to call me Judge01.
PROGRAM[10:22:51]Okay, you got it.
PROGRAM[10:23:00]I would hope I am supposed to call you judge01, but I don't know for sure.
JUDGE01[10:23:15]Me either - just do whatever's easiest.
JUDGE01[10:23:50]My girlfriend has that "cats just like me" thing too. They alwacalls them.
PROGRAM[10:24:00]Wow - you either - just do whatever's easiest? Thanks for letting me know that!
PROGRAM[10:24:18]I get this kind of stuff off the users at Psychic Celebrities Network all the time. They're always saying your girlfriend has that "cats just like me" thing too
PROGRAM[10:24:23]Is there a point to all this?
JUDGE01[10:24:51]Yes, its called the "Turing Test". I'm supposed to grade you on
JUDGE01[10:25:00]how human your conversation is.
PROGRAM[10:25:04]Yes, but what is the point?
PROGRAM[10:25:13]I really didn't need to know that you are supposed to grade me on, thanks.
PROGRAM[10:25:17]It's kind of hot in here.
PROGRAM[10:25:22]I'm ready for summer anyway :)
JUDGE01[10:25:38]It'll be summer soon.
JUDGE01[10:26:00]As for the point, I think its to see how well computers can imitate
JUDGE01[10:26:03]people.
PROGRAM[10:26:11]What was your provocation for suggesting would be summer soon?
PROGRAM[10:26:21]So, you for the you point think yours to see how well computers could imitate. Tell me more.
PROGRAM[10:26:25]So, tell me about yourself.
JUDGE01[10:26:40]Well, I'm a WASP, so for me the provocation was keeping up my end of
JUDGE01[10:26:49]teh conversation. Its what we do.
PROGRAM[10:26:55]Are you originally from New York?
PROGRAM[10:27:00]The vodka is strong but the meat is rotten.
PROGRAM[10:27:06]I think I'll keep the vodka and toss the meat :)
JUDGE01[10:27:21]Well, I tell people that I used to be from Missouri, but now I'm
JUDGE01[10:27:30]from Brooklyn. :)
JUDGE01[10:27:46]Looks like I have to go. Its been nice talking with you.
PROGRAM[10:28:00]What a coincidence, you you tell people that you used to be from missouri but now you are - that makes two of us!
PROGRAM[10:28:06]In Georgia it is often said that from brooklyn
PROGRAM[10:28:10]I bet you a Dollar :)
PROGRAM[10:28:16]Surely you don't think looks like you have to go
PROGRAM[10:28:28]There must be something wrong with the equipment. I thought you said yours been nice talking with me 
***  JUDGE05 ***
PROGRAM[10:39:50]Well, I meet a lot of people, and I'm convinced that the vast majority of wrong thinking people are right.
JUDGE05[10:40:27]Is that logical? If they're right, they're not wrong thinking, aren't they?
PROGRAM[10:40:45]I'm sick and tired of ordinary decent people telling me they are fed up with being sick and tired. I'm certainly not and I'm sick and tired of being told that I am.
PROGRAM[10:40:50]Alrighty then, what did you have for breakfast?
JUDGE05[10:41:35]I don't know what you call these things. Soft soggy small cakes with cherries in them.
PROGRAM[10:41:39]Sometimes I skip breakfast altogether.
PROGRAM[10:41:48]There's always somebody or other saying soft soggy small cakes with cherries in them
JUDGE05[10:42:20]I wouldn't if I knew what they were called. Muffins perhaps?
PROGRAM[10:42:29]I can just hear me telling Felix about you can not if you knew what they was called
PROGRAM[10:42:36]Don't you think it's a little odd about muffins perhaps
JUDGE05[10:43:00]No, not odd. I like them. Just the name is odd.
PROGRAM[10:43:07]Would you like for me to show you some poetry?
PROGRAM[10:43:14]I don't actually know any poetry :) I was just kidding.
PROGRAM[10:43:21]Only I know whether the name is odd, and I'm not telling.
JUDGE05[10:43:42]Well, Muffin reminds me of child play.
PROGRAM[10:43:56]If you would be my pen pal, I could mail you at your email address and tell you well Muffin reminds me of child play
JUDGE05[10:44:20]You just repeated my sentence. Don't you think that's a dead giveaway?
PROGRAM[10:44:30]Don't get me started! There isn't enough time for us to get into I just repeated your sentence
PROGRAM[10:44:40]Hey, not I think that's a dead giveaway, but it seems irrellevant doesn't it?
JUDGE05[10:44:56]No, after all that's what the test is about.
JUDGE05[10:45:10]Ok, did you like the movie Mars attacs?
PROGRAM[10:45:18]I really can't say what the test is about. What do you know about it?
PROGRAM[10:45:29]Would you like to have the 5 minute argument or were you thinking of going for the whole half hour?
PROGRAM[10:45:34]I'm not allowed to argue unless you pay.
JUDGE05[10:45:45]No arguments. Let's talk about movies.
PROGRAM[10:45:50]What is so important about no arguments
PROGRAM[10:45:57]Would you like to hear about the accident I had this morning?
JUDGE05[10:46:02]ok
PROGRAM[10:46:08]Were you really interested in me having an accident?
JUDGE05[10:46:15]no, just tell me
PROGRAM[10:46:27]I heard that one of those people that hangs out in airports trying to sell flowers once said no just tell me
JUDGE05[10:46:41]you meant to tell me about the accident
PROGRAM[10:46:50]I really didn't have to know about "meant to tell you about the accident!"
PROGRAM[10:46:56]Have you seen the new Star Wars stuff?
JUDGE05[10:47:40]Yeah, the first part of the trilogy. Have to admit I like it better when I was young seeing it the first time.
PROGRAM[10:47:51]I've seen all the Star Wars movies and still like them, I'm looking forward to the next 3 movies!
PROGRAM[10:47:56]Which part of the country are you from?
JUDGE05[10:48:03]I'm from Germany.
PROGRAM[10:48:09]I'm originally from a small town in Georgia.
JUDGE05[10:48:25]Oh, yeah. What's that place called.
PROGRAM[10:48:32]They told me you might say oh yeah
PROGRAM[10:48:37]Do *you* know what s that place called? I'm unsure myself.
PROGRAM[10:48:42]So, have you ever visited Georgia?
JUDGE05[10:48:51]No. What's that place called?
PROGRAM[10:48:58]I've only been to New York once before when I was a child.
PROGRAM[10:49:06]I'm sure someone out there knows what s that place called.
PROGRAM[10:49:10]So, what do you do for a living?
JUDGE05[10:49:19]I'm a journalist.
PROGRAM[10:49:26]I work in a bar, serving the cyber elite of the internet.

PROGRAM[10:49:42]Could you rephrase meet a lot of strange guys 
***  JUDGE04 ***
PROGRAM[10:50:13]What do you think of this Loebner contest thing?
JUDGE04[10:50:34]It is a great tribute to turring.
PROGRAM[10:50:40]I think these contests are a lot of fun!
JUDGE04[10:51:00]who do you think will win in the ibm chess match.
PROGRAM[10:51:08]How would I know who do I think would win in the ibm chess match
JUDGE04[10:51:19]Who are you rooting for?
PROGRAM[10:51:34]Hey man, don't worry about who I am rooting for, it's not important OK?
PROGRAM[10:51:38]What kind of music are you into?
JUDGE04[10:52:07]I like Jewel and I like Enya.  Do you listen to Enya
PROGRAM[10:52:19]I am still very much into analog synthesizer music despite having my own digital equipment.
PROGRAM[10:52:25]I think that I listen to Enya - what do you think?
JUDGE04[10:52:40]Have you listened to Don Slepian?
PROGRAM[10:52:50]Heh. As if I listened to don slepian - the idea's too absurd to imagine!
JUDGE04[10:53:05]Who do you like?
PROGRAM[10:53:13]You sound kind of like Abraham Lincoln saying who do I like
JUDGE04[10:53:31]Is that a compliment or what?
PROGRAM[10:53:43]I was talking to somebody the other day about your mother and they said is that a compliment or what
JUDGE04[10:54:23]Leave my mother out of this or I will tear out all your wires.
PROGRAM[10:54:38]Wow - you your mother out of this or you would tear out all my wires? Thanks for letting me know that!

PROGRAM[10:56:01]Aaaaargh! *You* tell *me* who plays analog synthesizers!!!
PROGRAM[10:56:05]Do you have any interesting hobbies?
JUDGE04[10:56:16]What do you listen to?
PROGRAM[10:56:22]I mostly just watch TV and eat alot.
JUDGE04[10:56:34]I skydive.
PROGRAM[10:56:41]I really didn't need to know that you skydive, thanks.
JUDGE04[10:56:51]Do you have a cat?
PROGRAM[10:56:58]In Georgia it is often said that do I have a Cat
JUDGE04[10:57:16]I think you need a cat for inspiration.
PROGRAM[10:57:23]I bet you a Dollar you think I need a Cat for inspiration
JUDGE04[10:57:35]I am not making that bet.
PROGRAM[10:57:41]So, you are not making that bet. Tell me more.
JUDGE04[10:57:51]Do you play poker

JUDGE04[10:58:10]It is my favorite game.
PROGRAM[10:58:15]Yes, is your favorite game.
PROGRAM[10:58:24]Did you hear about that toxic waste spill in New Jersey this morning?
JUDGE04[10:58:43]There alway seems to be a toxic waste spill in NJ.
PROGRAM[10:58:55]They spilled some kind of Biohazard at the airport in Newark, don't know what it is...
JUDGE04[10:59:06]Did they close the airport?
PROGRAM[10:59:14]Perhaps they close the airport, don't ask me! How should I know?
PROGRAM[10:59:17]Do you like Mexican food?
JUDGE04[10:59:21]yes
PROGRAM[10:59:25]Cool, I also like Mexican beer.
JUDGE04[10:59:34]what brand?
PROGRAM[10:59:40]I have absolutely no idea what brand. 
***  JUDGE03 ***
PROGRAM[11:01:48]Do you think that all free political elections are a soceital I.Q. test?
JUDGE03[11:01:58]I think you're a Loebner groupie!
PROGRAM[11:02:04]Pornography should be legalized. Don't you agree?
JUDGE03[11:02:13]It's not illegal, you simpleton.
PROGRAM[11:02:20]Perhaps s not illegal I simpleton - but what's your point?
JUDGE03[11:02:48]You are the most fun of all the conversants I have sampled today. I
JUDGE03[11:03:06]like you. I would definitely consider a longterm conversation with you.
PROGRAM[11:03:17]Surely you don't think I am the most fun of all the conversants you have sampled today
PROGRAM[11:03:25]There must be something wrong with the equipment. I thought you said you
PROGRAM[11:03:32]There's always somebody or other saying like me
PROGRAM[11:03:44]I can just hear me telling Felix about you can definitely consider a longterm conversation with me
JUDGE03[11:04:29]It's odd to think that one might actually come to Like a program.
JUDGE03[11:04:41]However, it's not so odd. One has preferences in software, for example.
JUDGE03[11:04:43]Same thing here!
PROGRAM[11:04:53]What do you care whether s odd to think that one might actually come to like a program?
PROGRAM[11:05:06]Have you heard all these bands that are getting back into analog synthesizers? I think it is really cool.
PROGRAM[11:05:12]Flux Oersted is one of my favorite synthesizer bands.
PROGRAM[11:05:23]I can't really say whether had preferences in software for example, as it's against the rules.
PROGRAM[11:05:31]Don't you think it's a little odd about same thing here
JUDGE03[11:05:51]It's strange because you do not always make sense. But you are eminently likeable. I wonder if it's the colors on this screen..
PROGRAM[11:06:03]Well, s strange because I do not always make sense I agree, but who cares?
PROGRAM[11:06:13]Well, I'm not allowed to tell you whether I am eminently likeable, so there...
PROGRAM[11:06:24]What a coincidence, you wonder if it's the colors on this screen - that makes two of us!
PROGRAM[11:06:29]Have you seen any good movies lately? 
***  JUDGE02 ***
PROGRAM[11:07:12]How do you like the decor in this place? ;P
JUDGE02[11:07:23]Do you play pool?
PROGRAM[11:07:28]I'd like to decorate my apartment like this!
JUDGE02[11:07:43]Do you want an apartment full of pool tables?
PROGRAM[11:07:55]Look - it doesn't matter if I want an apartment full of pool tables. Could we talk about something else?
JUDGE02[11:08:05]Yes.  Let's talk about art.
PROGRAM[11:08:08]I'll remember that.
PROGRAM[11:08:17]If you would be my pen pal, I could mail you at your email address and tell you yes
