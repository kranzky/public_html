<H1>The Learning Machine Challenge</H1>
<H2>Official Announcement</H2>
<CENTER>
<TABLE WIDTH="80%">
<P>Artificial Intelligence (Ai) is sponsoring the global Learning Machine
Challenge to promote original research in artificial intelligence and
machine learning.</P>
<H3>The challenge</H3>
<P><I>Create a program that can win at a game without knowing the game's
rules.</I></P>
<P>Your program will compete against the programs of other contestants in
simple turn-based games. <B>The rules of the games will not be explained
beforehand</B>. Your program will be notified of its opponent's previous move,
and after your program makes a move, it will be notified of a win, loss,
or draw. Games will consist of many thousands of moves.</P>
<H3>The prize</H3>
<P><I>$2,000 will be awarded to the creator of the winning
program.</I></P>
<P>Representatives of the top three winning programs will be invited to an
all expenses paid artificial intelligence workshop at our research
headquarters in Israel.  The winners will be decided after a round-robin
tournament is held on a series of different games. <B>$25,000 will be won
by the creator of the winning program if we decide to use it
commercially.</B></P>
<H3>Who can enter?</H3>
<P><I>Individuals, research groups, and commercial entities are all welcome
to compete.</I></P>
<P>There is no entry fee, and you may submit more than one entry. There is
no need to submit source code, as executable binaries which run under
Windows or Linux on a high-end PC will be accepted. You are under no
obligation to reveal the details of your program to Ai. You retain
complete copyright over your work.</P>
<H3>Deadline: October 30, 2001</H3>
<P><I>The deadline for submission is Tuesday, October 30, 2001, 11:59
PM.</I></P>
<P>Results of the challenge will be announced on January 1, 2002.  More
information about the Learning Machine Challenge, including a registration
form, example games, and a downloadable test suite, is available at <A
HREF="http://www.a-i.com/challenge/">www.a-i.com/challenge</A>.  Send
email to <A HREF="mailto:challenge@a-i.com">challenge@a-i.com</A> with any
questions.</P>
<P>The contest is coordinated by Jason Hutchens, winner of the 1996
Loebner Prize in Artificial Intelligence and Chief Scientist at Ai.  Jason
will attend IJCAI-01, and hopes to meet Learning Machine Challenge
contestants there.  Contact him at +011-972-54-288914 or
hutch@A-i.com.</P>
<P ID="Disclaimer">The Learning Machine Challenge is sponsored by
Artificial Intelligence N.V., a private research company whose goal is to
develop a child machine with the ability to learn and use language in the
same way as human beings do.  We are conducting the challenge to evaluate
the performance of novel and state-of-the-art general learning systems.
We reserve the right to evaluate the performance of submitted programs in
language learning scenarios. The Learning Machine Challenge was inspired
by Darse Billing's International RoShamBo Programming Competition.</P>
<P>If you have any questions about the Learning Machine Challenge, please
don't hesitate to send an email to
