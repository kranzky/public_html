<H1>The Learning Machine Challenge</H1>
<H2>Specification of the API</H2>
<CENTER>
<TABLE WIDTH="80%">
<TR><TD>
<P>To enter the Learning Machine Challenge, your program is required to
conform to a simple API.  This API allows your program to communicate with
the judge program using standard input/output functions: exactly the kind
of functions you'd use to read from and write to the console.</P>
<P>There are several advantages to doing things this way.  It enables you
to test your program directly, by running it in a stand-alone fashion and
playing the role of judge yourself.  Also, it gives you the opportunity to
submit source code written in your programming language of choice.  You
can even submit a binary executable!  Finally, it is platform-independent,
meaning that we can support both Windows and Linux binaries.</P>
<P>We have provided you with example programs, written in a variety of
programming languages, in the
<A HREF="Download.html">download section</A>.  These example programs
completely implement the API, and you may wish to base your entry on
them.</P>
<H3>Interface Specification</H3>
<P>Your program is a "black box" which communicates with the outside world
via a number of different "channels".  These channels are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The <B>input</B> channel.  This channel allows your program to observe
moves coming in from the outside world.</LI>
<LI>The <B>output</B> channel.  This channel allows your program to send a
move to the outside world.</LI>
<LI>The <B>score</B> channel.  This channel allows the judge to inform
your program of its score.</LI>
<LI>The <B>command</B> channel.  This channel allows the judge to send
special commands to your program.</LI>
<LI>The <B>info</B> channel.  This channel allows your program to send
special informational messages to the judge.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Each of these five channels is implemented using standard input/output
operations.  This requires a special syntax to be used.  The syntax is
line-based, and specifies a channel, along with the data which is to be
transmitted over that channel.  The basic syntax is:</P>
<XMP>
@channel data
</XMP>
<P>Where <TT>channel</TT> is the name of the channel and <TT>data</TT> is
channel-specific data.  Note that a single space character separates the
channel name from the channel data and that the channel data is a string
which is terminated by the end-of-line.</P>
<H4>The Input Channel</H4>
<P>The input channel allows your program to observe a move coming in from
the outside word.  The input channel is the default channel coming into
your program, and so the channel specifier is optional.  The syntax of the
input channel is:</P>
<XMP>
[@input ]string
</XMP>
<P>Where <TT>string</TT> is a valid move, represented as a string which
contains no whitespace.</P>
<H4>The output channel</H4>
<P>The output channel allows your program to make a move itself.  The
output channel is the default channel coming out of your program, and so
the channel specifier is optional.  The syntax of the output channel
is:</P>
<XMP>
[@output ]string
</XMP>
<P>Where <TT>string</TT> is a valid move, represented as a string which
contains no whitespace.</P>
<H4>The score channel</H4>
<P>The score channel is used by the judge program to inform your program
of its score.  The syntax of the score channel is:</P>
<XMP>
@score number
</XMP>
<P>Where <TT>number</TT> is a floating-point number between -1.0 and
+1.0.</P>
<H4>The command channel</H4>
<P>The command channel is used by the judge program to send information to
your program or request it to perform an action.  There are four
different commands, and we'll describe them one-by-one.</P>
<P>To begin with, the judge program can ask your program to exit cleanly.
The syntax of this command is:</P>
<XMP>
@command exit
</XMP>
<P>When your program receives an exit command, it should do any cleaning
up which it needs to perform and it should terminate itself.</P>
<P>The judge program can inform your program that it is about to begin a
new game against a new player.  The syntax of this command is:</P>
<XMP>
@command new
</XMP>
<P>When your program receives a new command it should perform any
initialisation which it needs to perform before beginning a new game with
a new player.</P>
<P>The judge program can inform your program of the set of valid move
symbols by using the symbol command.  The syntax of this command is:</P>
<XMP>
@command symbol string
</XMP>
<P>Where <TT>string</TT> contains no whitespace.  The string constitutes a
valid move symbol.  Your program can only read valid move symbols from its
input channel and write valid symbols to its output channel.</P>
<P>Finally, the judge program can ask your program to make a move.  The
syntax of this command is:</P>
<XMP>
@command play
</XMP>
<P>When your program receives a play command it should emit exactly one
valid symbol to its output channel using the <TT>[@output ]string</TT>
syntax.</P>
<H4>The info channel</H4>
<P>The info channel allows your program to send informational messages to
the judge program.  There are two such messages, and we will describe them
one-by-one.</P>
<P>The exit informational message informs the judge program that your
program is about to exit.  The syntax of this informational message
is:</P>
<XMP>
@info exit
</XMP>
<P>You should send the exit informational message  to the judge program
whenever your program exits for any reason.</P>
<P>The name informational message informs the judge program of your
program's name.  The syntax of this informational message is:</P>
<XMP>
@info name string
</XMP>
<P>Where <TT>string</TT> contains no whitespace, and represents the name
of your program.  Your program is required to send its name to the judge
program before it does anything else.</P>
<H4>Comments</H4>
<P>Your program may also send comments to the judge program, and should be
prepared to receive comments from the judge program.  A comment is a line
which begins with the <TT>#</TT> symbol, and all such lines should be
ignored.  The judge program will display any comments it receives in its
interface, which may prove extremely useful for debugging purposes.</P>
<H4>Warning</H4>
<P>As we have defined a console-based API, you must make sure not to read
from or write to the console for other purposes!  Doing so will confuse
the judge program!</P>
<H3>Tournament specification</H3>
<P>The judge program runs the tournament by communicating with the
competing programs via the console-based API defined above.  The judge
program will follow a particular order when doing this:</P>
<OL>
<LI>When the judge program runs your program for the first time, it will
wait for your program to inform it of its name, via <TT>@info name
string</TT>.  Your program is required to do this within ten seconds of
being invoked.</LI>
<LI>The judge program will issue a new command, via <TT>@command new</TT>,
to begin a new game.</LI>
<LI>The judge program will then transmit the entire set of valid move
symbols to your program, via <TT>@command symbol string</TT>.  Each
command transmits one symbol, and the judge program will issue at least
two such commands, as each game contains at least two valid move symbols.
The game will then begin.</LI>
<LI>The judge will ask your program to make a move, via <TT>@command
play</TT>, send your program some input, via <TT>[@input ]string</TT>, or
give your program a score, via <TT>@score number</TT>.
<LI>Step 4 will be repeated many times, giving your program an opportunity
to learn from its experience.  For example, your program may be asked to
make two moves before being given a score, and then it may observe three moves
on its input channel in a row before being asked to make another move
itself.</LI>
<LI>Once the game has concluded, the judge program may initiate a new game
by repeating from step 2.  Alternatively, it may terminate your program by
issuing a <TT>@command exit</TT> command.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The judge program will conduct games in this way between all
programs.</P>
<H3>Example</H3>
<P>We will demonstrate the API by showing how a judge may run a
Rock-Paper-Scissors competition between two programs.  For clarity, we
will only show the responses of one program.  The other contestant, not
shown here, returns the move "rock" on every turn.</P>

</CENTER>
<P>We should stress that the sequence shown here (the judge program asks
the player to make a move, it then sends the player the opponent's move,
and it finally sends the player its score) is peculiar to the
Rock-Paper-Scissors game.  Other kinds of game may function
differently.  Also, although this example only consists of a few turns,
games in the tournament will typically consist of many thousands of
turns.</P>

section, where you will be able to download the judge program and some
sample players which implement the above API.</P>
