<H1>The Learning Machine Challenge</H1>
<H2>Detailed Information</H2>

<TR><TD>
<P>The Learning Machine Challenge consists of a round-robin tournament, in
which all the submitted programs will play each other in a number of
different games.  The games won't be revealed to you, so you will need to
come up with a program which can learn to play an unknown game against an
unknown opponent.  A <A HREF="Overview.html">quick overview</A> of the
challenge is available.  The Learning Machine Challenge was announced at
The Seventeenth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,
and the <A HREF="Announcement.html">text of that announcement</A> is also
available.</P>
<H3>How does it work?</H3>
<P>All programs entered into the Learning Machine Challenge are required
to conform to a very simple interface.  This interface is console-based,
freeing you to use your programming language of choice.  In fact, you are
free to submit a binary executable if you desire: there is no need for
you to reveal your source code to us!  This interface allows an external
judge program to moderate head-to-head games between two programs
easily.  A complete <A HREF="API.html">specification of the interface</A>
is available.</P>
<P>When a new game begins, the judge program will inform each player
program of the set of possible moves in the game.  Each move is
represented as a string, and the set will contain between two and eighty
strings.  For example, one game may have only three valid moves: "rock",
"paper" and "scissors".  Other games may have more, such as the twenty-six
uppercase alphabetic characters, or the ten digits.</P>
<P>Once the game is underway, one of three things may happen.  Your
program may observe a move on its input channel, it may be asked to
generate a move on its output channel, or it may be informed of its score.
These things may happen in any order, so, for example, your program may
observe three moves in a row, be asked to generate two moves, observe one
more move, and then be told its score.  This sequence will make sense in
the context of the game, which, of course, is only known to the judge
program.  Furthermore, moves which your program observes on its input
channel may or may not have been generated by an opponent.</P>
<P><B>A good example game is RoShamBo, or Rock-Paper-Scissors</B>.  After
being informed that the set of possible moves consists of the three
strings "rock", "paper" and "scissors", the judge program will ask your
program to generate a move.  Unbeknownst to your program, the judge
program will simultaneously ask its opponent to do the same.  Once both
programs have made their moves, the judge program will send each program
the move of their opponent as input.  It will then calculate the winner
using the algorithm "paper beats rock, rock beats scissors and scissors
beats paper", with a draw occurring if each program makes the same move.
The score will then be sent to each program as a number between -1 and 1
(with 0 representing a draw).  One game will typically consist of many
thousands of rounds, giving your program the opportunity to learn from its
experience.  Each program should, of course, strive to get the highest
score possible.</P>
<P>A round-robin tournament will be held to select the winner of the
Learning Machine Challenge.  All combinations of players will take part in
all games, of which there will be between six and twelve.  Some of the
games may be solitary, but this shouldn't effect the design of your
program (it simply changes the source of the moves it observes on its
input channel).  Programs will be ranked by their total score in the
tournament, and the program with the highest score will be declared the
winner.</P>
<H3>Why are we sponsoring it?</H3>
<P>Artificial Intelligence NV is a private research company dedicated to
achieving the "holy grail" of artificial intelligence: a computer program
which has the ability to learn and use a natural language such as English.
Our philosophy is that this is achievable using general learning
mechanisms, and we embrace the behaviourist black-box approach to
learning.  We encourage research on state-of-the-art general learning
algorithms, and are interested in their strengths and weaknesses with
respect to the language learning task.</P>
<P>For more information about Artificial Intelligence NV, please see
<A HREF="http://www.a-i.com">the Ai home page</A>.
<H3>Why should you enter?</H3>
<P>The Learning Machine Challenge standardises the interface between a
learning algorithm and the outside world.  This enables quite different
approaches to learning to be compared directly with one another.  You may
already have a learning system which you have developed.  This is a
fantastic opportunity for you to prove the abilities of your system to the
rest of the world.  Can your system beat the best on offer?  Can it learn
more quickly than a state-of-the-art neural network developed by one of
the world's leading universities?  These are the questions which the
Learning Machine Challenge will answer.  We are confident that the results
will be surprising and revealing.</P>
<P>Great advances often come from individuals and outsiders who look at
the problem from a different angle.  You may be a hobbyist programmer with
a great idea, and the Learning Machine Challenge gives you the opportunity
to try it out.  We accept entries from individuals, groups, university
departments, commercial research institutes, companies; the list goes on.
If you think you have what it takes, there is no reason not to enter!</P>
<P>We understand that your approach may be proprietary, and we respect
that.  You are free to enter anonymously, and your entry may consist of a
binary executable (as long as it runs under Windows or Linux).  You are
under no obligation to reveal any details of your submission to us
whatsoever, and you retain complete copyright over your work.  We won't
give your program to anybody else.  We do, however, reserve the right to
test your program in language learning scenarios, because that's the kind
of learning which we're interested in.</P>
<P>By entering you stand to win a prize.  $2,000 will be awarded to the
creator of the winning program, and representatives of the top three
winning programs will be invited to an all expenses paid artificial
intelligence workshop at our research headquarters in Israel.
Additionally, $25,000 will be won by the creator of the winning program if
we decide to use it commercially.</P>
