<UL>
<LI>Entries are welcomed from individuals, groups, university departments

<LI>Employees of Artificial Intelligence NV may not participate.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>What do I enter</H3>
<UL>
<LI>You need to enter a program which conforms to our interface.  See the
<A HREF="API.html">interface specification</A> for details.</LI>
<LI>Your can enter a binary executable, as long as it runs under Windows
or Linux on a PC.</LI>
<LI>You can enter source code.  We plan to support at least C, C++, Lisp,
Prolog, Java, VisualBasic and TCL, and we are prepared to support other
languages (including scripting languages) provided that freely available
compilers and/or interpreters are available for them.</LI>
<LI>If your program requires special resources, such as shared libraries,
you are required to provide them to us.</LI>
<LI>Information about how to submit your entry is available from the
<A HREF="Register.html">registration page</A>.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>What are the restrictions</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Your program must not open a network connection.</LI>
<LI>The tournament will be held on an 800MhZ PentiumIII with 256Mb of
memory and 10Gb of free disk space.  The tournament machine will be
isolated from the network.</LI>
<LI>Your program must be able to make at least ten moves per second on
the tournament machine.</LI>
<LI>Your program must inform the judge program of its name within ten
seconds of being invoked.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>When is the deadline</H3>
<UL>
<LI>You need to submit your final entry by midnight on October 30,
2001.</LI>
<LI>We will spend the month of November bug-testing entries.  During this
month you may be contacted by us.</LI>
<LI>The tournament will be held during the month of December, 2001.</LI>
<LI>The winners will be announced on January 1, 2001.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Tournament information</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Each program submitted by the deadline and which passes the bug-testing
phase will participate in the tournament.</LI>
<LI>A program which makes moves at random will participate to provide a
benchmark.</LI>
<LI>The tournament will involve between six and twelve games, and the
nature of these games will be finalised before the deadline, but won't be
revealed until the results are announced.</LI>
<LI>The winning submission will be awarded a prize of $2000.</LI>
<LI>Representatives of the top three submissions will be invited to an
all-expenses-paid artificial intelligence workshop to be held at our
research headquarters in Israel.</LI>
<LI>Programs may be evaluated in language-learning scenarios, and may play
games against a human opponent, but the results of these tests will not
contribute towards those of the tournament.</LI>
</UL>
