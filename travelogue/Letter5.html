<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: letter five</H1>

<P>Greetings all!  Well, it's been an absolute age since I last wrote.  Many
months, in fact.  Just long enough for me to have forgotten the intervening
period, meaning that this letter will be a great deal shorter owing to lack of
information.</P>

<P>When I last wrote I was about to head off to Lisbon in Portugal for a
conference.  And, of course, a holiday.  Cathy, Tsung and D. were to join me
for the weekend following the conclusion of the conference.  But I had to get
over there first, and that proved to be a good sight more complicated than I
had envisioned.</P>

<P>It turns out that Portugal had a bit of a disagreement with Australia
concerning the number of East Timorese refugees allowed into our country
(East Timor being a former Portugese colony).  They protested at this by
requiring all Aussie visitors to their country to carry an entry visa.
Australia reciprocated, of course, resulting in a stalemate.  The upshot of
all this is that innocent tourists are inconvenienced and nothing political is
resolved.</P>

<P>Getting an entry visa is not normally a problem, but I needed to get one
from the Portugese consulate in downtown Tel Aviv, and it turns out that
they've never issued an entry visa to an Australian citizen before.  They put
it down as a learning experience, but from my point of view it was two weeks
of frustration personified.</P>

<P>In the end it was all worth it.  The conference was a rather lacklustre
affair, but that is usually the case with conferences anyway so I didn't
complain.  The highlight was probably the taxi ride to the hotel from the
airport.  Taxi drivers around the world are generally insane, but Portugese
taxi drivers really take the cake.</P>
