<TD>Get a quick impression of the kinds of things I've been doing by
looking at a random collage of sixteen photgraphs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="AroundTheWorld.html">around the world</A></TD>
<TD>The Reader's Digest version of the letters I sent back home to family
and friends during my first "boondoggle", a fifty-six day around-the-world
journey.  My budget came out to fifty Australian dollars per-day, including
food, accommodation and incidental travel, which means I slummed it big time.
It was great!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
<A HREF="Letter1.html">letter one</A><BR>
</TD>
<TD>While abroad I try to write home to family and friends.  It turns out
that I manage one letter ever three months.  I know that's not much, but you'd
be impressed at the circulation.  My mum gives then to everyone she knows,
and my grandparents do the same.  Unknown people approach me in the street and
want to know when the book's coming out!  After submitting my PhD I moved to
London to be with my girlfriend and have a working holiday.  This first letter
talks about Christmas and New Year in London.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
<A HREF="Letter2.html">letter two</A><BR>
</TD>
<TD>This, the second of my letters back home, talks about my job at Lionhead
Studios, a weekend away in Amsterdam, and a day trip to Oxford.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
<A HREF="Letter3.html">letter three</A><BR>
</TD>
<TD>My third letter back home focuses on some of the many activities we
pursued in London, and ends with a four day holiday in Spain and a weekend
away in Belgium.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
<A HREF="Letter4.html">letter four</A>
</TD>
<TD>My long awaited fourth letter deals with my new job in Israel, beginning
with the brief holiday D. and I had in Israel and ending with a description
about what I do at work.  In between you'll find descriptions of holidays in
Derbyshire, Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, France,
Australia and Italy once again!  Funny how much happens when I neglect writing
letters for a few months!</TD></TR>


<TR><TD><A HREF="ski/Index.html">ski</A></TD>
<TD>Ade, Mark and myself went to Falls Creek in 1998.  This slide show features
some of the amazingly intricate moves which only first-time skiers can
perform.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="germany/Index.html">germany</A></TD>
<TD>My second ever "boondoggle" happened in mid-1999, courtesy of a German
company which Bruce and myself sold some software to.  This slide-show
covers the two weeks I spend in Hamburg.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="ireland/Index.html">ireland</A></TD>
<TD>I convinced the Germans to get me an around-the-world ticket (when you
come from Australia, it's often <I>cheaper</I> than a return journey to one
destination Europe).  After Hamburg I visited Nazy in Ireland, where I made
friends with Geoff, another ex-UWA engineer.  Surprisingly Ade turned up,
on the way home from his Big Snowboarding Adventure.  The four of us went
on a road trip through the Irish countryside.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="porno/Index.html">porno</A></TD>
<TD>Geoff and I returned home from the pub one night to find a pretty young
thing sprawled on the lounge room floor.  We decided to give her a thorough
pumping, and capture it all on video!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="america/Index.html">america</A></TD>
<TD>Still on the German "boondoggle", I returned to Australia via New York
City, where I met up with Gek and embarked on a road trip north, towards
Maine.  I also met up with a long time 'net friend in NYC itself.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="amsterdam/Index.html">amsterdam</A></TD>
<TD>A few pictures from a weekender in Amsterdam.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="oxford/Index.html">oxford</A></TD>
<TD>A whole group of us took a bus to Oxford one fine weekend, and I've got
the JPG's to prove it!</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="spain/Index.html">spain</A></TD>
<TD>D. and I visited Barcelona and Montserrat for a few days.  The mountainous
scenery is quite impressive.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="belgium/Index.html">belgium</A></TD>
<TD>I visited Brugges in Belgium one weekend with D., Cathy, Elaine and Lucy.
We only stayed one night, but managed to come back with quite a few
souvinirs.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="derby/Index.html">derby</A></TD>
<TD>Lucy lives in Derbyshire, and D., Cathy, Elaine and myself visited one
weekend.  We went to Stratford-Upon-Avon, the place where Shakespeare comes
from.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="israel/Index.html">israel</A></TD>
<TD>D. and I visited Israel for four days, and were treated to a helicopter
tour of the country.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="italy/Index.html">italy</A></TD>
<TD>I went to a conference in Bellagio, on the shore of Lake Como, in
Italy.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="portugal/Index.html">portugal</A></TD>
<TD>In early September 2000 I attended three conferences in Lisbon,
Portugal.  We went on a sightseeing tour, hence the pictures.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="perth/Index.html">perth</A></TD>
<TD>In April 2001 D. and I returned to Perth, our home town, for three
weeks.  We hardly took any pictures.  What we did take is here.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="D1/Index.html">d set one</A></TD>
<TD>My girlfriend travelled to Ireland, and sent me home a few sets of
photographs.  I scanned them in and put them online here, along with the
messages which she wrote on the back of them.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><A HREF="D2/Index.html">d set two</A></TD>
<TD>This is the second set of photographs I received from my girlfriend
while she was on her Irish adventure.</TD></TR>
