<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: around the world</H1>
<P>At the end of 1996 I travelled around the world with the intention of
attending a conference and visiting various universities to present my
research work.  Of course, I used the opportunity to do a bit of
sightseeing and as you will see I had several interesting experiences!</P>
<H2>First Stop Rome!</H2>
<P>The flight across was quite uneventful.  I didn't drink copious amounts of
alcohol as some of my contemporaries are wont to do, and I did sleep for
about eight hours.  The highlight was flying over the Swiss Alps on the
way to Rome.  Rome was a wonderful city from a historical point of view.
I visited the Colloseum, Pantheon, Roman Forum, Vatical and Sistene Chapel
as well as a castle.</P>
<P>Everything I was told about Italian drivers was true.  Crossing the road
would be considered suicidal for the average tourist, but luckily my many
years of experience crossing Broadway to get lunch at Mothers prepared
me well.  Basically, you look straight ahead and step into heavy traffic
while walking at a steady pace, trusting the drivers to see you and avoid
hitting you.</P>
<P>I stayed in a really shoddy "pensionne" for $25 a night, which is dirt cheap
by Roman standards.  On the first night, 7 guys slept in one tiny room, and
I had to share the double bed with a guy from Brazil!  Naturally, we became
close friends and went to the Colloseum together.</P>
<H2>Rome to Geneva</H2>
<P>I was quite relieved to leave Rome.  The guy who ran the pensionne was an
Italian Basil Fawlty, and he spoke little English.  He allowed me to leave my
my bag in the building for a few hours so I could walk around unimpeded.
When I returned to pick it up he told me he had moved it, and he spent
several nerve-wracking minutes crawling around on the floor looking under
beds and tables before he found it in a cupboard.</P>
<P>The train journey from Rome to Geneva was a thirteen hour hell-ride.  My
$40 couchette entilted me to a tiny bed in a cramped room with five others.
I arrived in Geneva dishevelled and in need of a shower.  Fortunately the
youth hostel here is really nice.  I am scheduled to present a talk tomorrow
(for $300, if you don't mind), but after that I am free to tour the country
for a few days.  I met a guy from the US in the hostel, and he has hired a car, so we plan to drive to Monte Blanc and the Swiss Alps over the weekend.</P>
<H2>Travelling Around Switzerland</H2>
<P>Geneva seems to attract all sorts of weird people.  One of the guys
staying in my room at the hostel is from Norway, and he claims that
he was an officer in the Norwegian army.  He quit after a while
because of "bodily problems".  He has the disconcerting ability to
gaze at you with one eye while the other darts around looking for
someone more interesting to intimidate, and he paces the halls in
big army boots at odd hours of the night.</P>
<P>Luckily I escaped - I met a guy who had hired a little VW and he
asked me whether I would like to tour the country with him.  Of
course, I jumped at the oppurtunity.  For two days we travelled
around Switzerland, ending up at Interlaken at the base of the Swiss
Alps.  The scenery was quite beautiful, and this contrasted with the
youth hostel there.</P>
<P>The hostel is basically run by Americans for Americans.  When I
walked in, everyone was watching The Simpsons.  The guys in my room
were all college jocks on their vacation, doing the traditional
European Tour.  It was basically one huge frat party, and all I
wanted to do was get some rest.  If you have seen any American
College movies, you can imagine what it was like.  Needless to say,
I didn't enjoy my stay there.</P>
<P>The next day we decided to walk up a mountain.  In hindsight it
was a pretty silly thing to do, but it seemed like a good idea at
the time.  It took us four hours to walk up a steep, rocky path
to the summit, 2000 metres above sea level.  We had basically
walked 1.5km straight up.  It was worth it for the views of the
Alps, and at 3pm we decided to trek down again, rather than catching
the train.</P>
<P>That was our first mistake.</P>
<P>We walked down for 40 minutes or so before we realised that it was
getting quite dark.  This was partly due to the fact that we were
in thick forest, and partly because we were inside a cloud!  It
soon started to rain quite heavily, and we got *soaked*.  We were
wet and miserable when we took the first wrong turn.</P>
<P>It was some time before we realised our mistake, and rather than
climbing back up we decided to push on.  Two hours later we found
ourselves in a paddock, surrounded by cows.  I decided to climb
over a fence, and got half way before I realised it was electrified.
The electric fences send a pulse of current every few seconds, so
I was shocked a few times before I made it over.</P>
<P>We walked through several paddocks before we came upon a road.  It
slowly dawned on us that we were at least a mile from the town where
we had started our walk.  We eventually made it back, and vowed to
leave for Geneva as soon as we had got some sleep.</P>
<P>Back in Geneva I checked in to the youth hostel.  I met a guy from
Perth, and a yank wearing a Guiness t-shirt.  It turned out we were
all dying for a Guiness, so we set out to find an English Pub.  A
pint (400ml over here) cost $9, but it was worth it.  It's the
last time I'll have a drink before getting to London, and I thought
I deserved it!</P>
<P>The guys wanted to wander around looking for cheaper beer.  We
eventually stumbled across a seedy little bar in downtown Geneva
where we got some Heineken's (in 200ml stubbies).  I noticed that
people were going in and out through an interior door, and that there
were a lot of large African ladies in the place.  When the largest
lady approached me and raised her eyebrows, we realised that we were
sitting in the entrace to a brothel!  We made our excuses and ran
away as fast as our legs could carry us.</P>
<H2>Geneva to Montpellier</H2>
<P>I caught the bullet train from Geneva to Montpellier, and it was pretty cool.
Our maximum speed was in excess of 350kph, and passing another train going
in the opposite direction when your relative velocity is 700kph is quite an
experience!</P>
<P>I arrived in Montpellier to find the youth hostel full.  As it was getting
late, I settled for an expensive one-star hotel.  The following day I
managed to squeeze into the hostel, which should offset the cost of the
first night somewhat.</P>
<P>I have spent most of ny tine at the conference, so I haven't had much of a
chance to look around (please excuse my typing by the way - I am using one
of these confusing French keyboards and I keep hitting letters where I
expect them to be rather than where they actually are).  There is an Indian
guy here who is the spitting image of Mr Bean, complete with rubbery face,
haircut, style of dress and mannerisms.  This kept me entertained
throughout the conference.</P>
<P>I can say one thing - the French certainly know how to eat!  At the conference
banquet last night, five hours passed between apertif and cafe!  I ate until
I was bloated, as it was the first "proper" food I've had since leaving
Australia.  I also drank a little more of the local French wine than I should
have, but it's difficult to refuse when they keep on putting new and 
interesting bottles in front of you to taste.</P>
<P>At the end of the night we were given two bottles to take with us - I will
probably give them to the professor guy in Wales in return for letting me
stay at his place.</P>
<H2>A Bit of Welsh</H2>
<P>When I was in Geneva, a bit of my shoe started to come off.  This is because
the bit was not stitched on as it should be, but was just glued on.  They
trick you, though, by putting fake embossed stitches on the bit that was now
coming off.  What I really needed was a "Mr Minit", and I was extremely
surprised and grateful to actually find one in the Geneva train station.  I
had no idea that "Mr Minit" was a multinational corporation.</P>
<P>I survived the conference in France, and managed to make only a few enemies
(basically by interjecting at some talks to tell the speaker that their work
was a load of fetid dingoes kidneys).  The most famous guy there looked like
Barney Rubble, and another looked like Mr Bean, so I generally hung around
giggling into my coffee and talking with other PhD students.</P>
<P>The flight into London was nice.  It turned out that one of the Japanese
guys from the conference was taking the same flight, so we talked about
Japan and Australia, Sony Playstations, Manga and so on.  His friend had
attended ICNN at UWA, and had great things to say about Perth.</P>
<P>I arrived in London to find it extremely busy - it was 5pm on a Saturday.
I caught the tube to Oxford street, where the youth hostel was supposed to
be.  I walked up and down the damned street half a dozen times, trying to
interpret the novel street numbering system where 15-24 can be on one side
while 17 and 18 are on the other.  Finally I found the hostel - an anonymous
black door in a wall.</P>
<P>I had a nice little room in the hostel with only three beds in it.  My two
roommates were from Hong Kong, and both of them claimed to have met Andy
Simper on the Metro.  That guy really made his presence felt in Europe!</P>
<P>The Londoners seem to be obsessed with statistics and warning signs for the
terminally stupid.  For example, at each major intersection they had "Look
to the left!" and "Look to the right!" painted on the road in large letters
for the pedestrians.  Also, many staircases have a sign near them declaring
that "This staircase contains 51 steps".  Weird.</P>
<P>My stay in London was short-lived, though, and I was soon on the train to
Bangor.  The trip was extremely boring - the bits of the UK near train lines
tend to be dirty and poor.  Bangor was a bit more interesting, though.  It
is a nice little student town near the sea.</P>
<P>I have spent my time here travelling to various castles.  Of note, I have seen
Conwy castle, Caernarfon castle, Beaumaris castle and Penryth castle.  Adrian
may have heard of these.  I also went to the top of Snowdon, the highest peak
in the UK, but on a train this time (I remembered my experience in the Alps).
At the top I found it completely overcast, so the view was non-existant.  I
also found out what "sleet" means, and "bitterly cold".</P>
<P>When they say it will be "overcast" in Wales, you have to be Welsh to know
what they mean.  In Australia, "overcast" generally means that there will be
clouds in the sky.  If a gap appears between the clouds, you can usually see
the blue sky, and a bit of sun comes through and makes you happy.  In Wales,
when it is overcast, it means that there are layers of cloud from just above
your head all the way to outer space.  If a gap appears between the clouds,
you just see more clouds.  It can be very depressing.</P>
<P>The food is interesing here.  Kebabs are much, much better than anything we get
in Australia.  You are served some Pita bread with a massive amount of meat,
chilli sauce and salad.  "Salad" also has a difference meaning here - you get
one slice of tomato and a bit of lettuce.  The fish and chips are much worse,
though.  You sit down inside the shop, and the guy gives you a plate of fatty,
soggy chips and a brown oily mass that they call "fish".</P>
<P>When I was eating my fish and chips, the shop was full of elderly Welsh men
doing the same thing, but enjoying it a lot more.  One guy looked just like
Yoda, except he wasn't green.  He was one of those old guys who look as if
they're wearing a mask, but they're not.  The wrinkles cover their face,
but stop all of a sudden so that their neck, chin and head is smooth.  They
were playing American songs from the 60's on the radio, and this Yoda guy
was bopping to the music.  It was very surrealistic, something that I would
expect David Lynch to come up with.  Or maybe George Lucas, if he went through
a peculiar stage.</P>
<H2>Visiting Oxford</H2>
<P>I gave a talk at the University of Wales and was overwhelmed at the turnout - three
people were in the audience, two of them being the guys who had arranged the talk.
Oh well.  The Professor guy I was visiting let me stay at his house for a couple of
nights, which was great: real food, shower and bed!  He and his wife took me out for
dinner, which turned out to be a traditional English Indian restaurant.  Chicken curry
with a pint of lager went down well.</P>
<P>I also stayed at the youth hostel in Bangor for a few nights.  Because it's off-season,
I shared a dormitory of twenty beds with one other person.  I ordered a fried English
breakfast there for 2 pounds, which was to be served at 8:15 sharp.  I woke up at 9, and
went downstairs to find the cook waiting for me.  I was the *only* person who had ordered
breakfast, and he cooked it for me there and then after making a few jokes at my late
arrival.</P>
<P>Currently, I am at Oxford where I have been visiting a few people.  Oxford is really nice,
especially if you like English pubs and pints of ale, which I certainly do.  Every person
I visited has taken me out drinking, which has been really great.  One of the guys, Steve
Moyle, is an Aussie, and he showed me around his favourite pubs, buying me pints of local
ales which don't make it to Australia.  As if that wasn't enough, we went to a freshers
bash at his college to drink free cocktails there (the academic year has just started this
week over here).</P>
<P>Due to bad planning, I found that I had only one day in which to see London.  I got a map
of the area, and circled all of the sights that I wanted to see.  The first place I visited
was Buck Palace, where I found the Queens Gallery was holding an exhibition of sketches by
Leonardo da Vinci.  Spending two hours there certainly screwed up my plans, but I still
managed to see Big Ben, Parliament, Downing Street, House Guards, Sherlock Holmes Museum,
Madame Tuseuds, Planetarium, Tower Bridge and the Tower of London in a single day!</P>
<H2>Start Spreading The News</H2>
<P>Well, I managed to get through Cambridge unscathed and with nothing
interesting to report.  I just visited some university boffin types
there and did little sightseeing.</P>
<P>I am now in the States, where I was shocked to discover that people
who serve you in shops really do instruct you to "Have a nice day".
I though that was just a myth.  I suppose it was no more shocking
than finding out that the people I was visiting in Wales actually
said "Gosh" when they heard something that surprised or impressed them.
Now, that was *really* weird!</P>
<P>New York City wasn't so bad.  The closest I got to gangland was a bus
ride through Queens - after that it appeared to be a disturbingly
safe place to live!  The countless homeless people are a bit crazy,
and you do pass people talking to themselves or dancing as they walk
across the street, but it's all part of the big city atmosphere.
Still, four cops were *shot* during the four days I was there, so I
guess I just saw the nice side of the city.</P>
<P>The view from the Empire State Building is impressive, when the smog
clears enough so that you can actually see something.  I also liked
the steam rushing out of the manholes - I though they just did that
for the movies!  It appears that New York has an underground steam
system for heating, or something.</P>
<P>Everything happens in New York.  Which I was there, an underground fire
in the sewage system caused manholes to explode, sending their covers
flying into the air, there was a plane crash at the airport, we had a
cyclone, police were shot, the world series baseball was on, etc etc.
I though Central Park was really nice.  I was stupid enough to walk
alone through the more secluded areas, but I wasn't mugged so that was
OK.  I passed a movie set where Al Pacino was filming some Shakespeare
story or something.  I visited the standard tourist destinations in
midtown Manhattan, and I took a bus ride through the other parts of the
island, including Harlem.  Still, I wasn't feeling brave enough to
catch the subway or walk alone through the less affluent areas.
I visited the toy store where the movie "Big" was filmed, they had
a huge Star Wars section (in readiness for the remastered films
coming out soon), which included a $15,000 Darth Vader costume.  The
Nintendo Ultra 64 was on display, and I can tell you that it looks
damned impressive.  The graphics are very smooth, and the texture
mapping is better than Playstation (the interpolation, which smooths
the textures instead of letting them become chunky, certainly helps).
Still, I did get to see all the new Playstation stuff at the Sony building.
Nothing special here, mostly just new games that won't make it to Australia
for a while.  I suppose you have already seen the F1 game, and that was
the one which impressed me the most, so nothing much I guess.  What was
nice was the new Sony PC - very impressive.</P>
<P>In New York I stayed in a dilapidated little brownstown which was
run by a Seinfeld-esque Jewish man called Art.  That guy could talk
the ear off something which has really big ears.  It seemed that I
was the only person staying there, but that suited me just fine.  For
$25 a night I got my own room with a TV, in midtown Manhattan where
rent is expensive.  I'm sure that the building wouldn't satisfy
even the most lenient of building standards - staircases aren't
supposed to be at funny angles, the floor shouldn't move when you walk
on it, and there shouldn't be gaping holes in the walls and ceilings,
hidden behind pieces of cloth taped there.</P>
<P>Well, now I'm in Providence.  The flight here was pretty cool, a 16
passenger prop-driven aircraft took 50 minutes to fly here, after
waiting at La Guardia for hours to get checked in.  There were thousands
of irate passengers there rebooking their flights after delays caused
by the plane crash.  I left NYC at 5:30am.  Walking to the bus through
the dark streets was an interesting experience.</P>
<P>Providence is just a University town - it's quite small and has it's fair
share of homeless and crazies.  Like the rest of the east coast, the
doughnuts and bagels are great but the coffee sucks.</P>
<H2>No Flower In My Hair!</H2>
<P>San Diego was really nice - it's so much like Perth that I
thought I had taken a wrong turn somewhere.  Some American guy
decided that Eucalyptus wood was ideal for railroad sleepers,
so he introduced the trees from Australia.  Of course, the wood
was way too soft, and the trees grew like crazy and now they're
everywhere!</P>
<P>In San Diego I took a visit to the zoo.  I went to the Bengal Tiger
area, where they have a nice natural exhibit.  It's basically
a bit of jungle, with a river and waterfall and everything.  Instead
of a cage, they have a soundproofed one-way mirror.  When I got
there, there was a huge crowd.  I pushed my way to the front, with my
trusty video camera, and saw this huge mother of a tiger right near
the glass, drinking from a pool of water.</P>
<P>Now, tigers are territorial, and they mark their home with scent.
They usually do this after eating or drinking.  When the great beast
stood up, all the tourists started screaming.  One lady pressed up
against the glass, and yelled at her husband that the tiger was
right in front of her!  Of course, the obvious happened.  She would
have been hit full-on in the face by a spray of scent if the glass
wasn't there to stop it.</P>
<P>In San Diego, I also took a tour of a warship that was in dock.  It
was the first ship to launch a Tomahawk missile during the Gulf war,
and the crew was rather proud of that fact.  In my tour group was
an elderly war veteran, and I was apalled at his attitude towards
war, and that of the crew.  Our guide stated that the USA doesn't
have problems with any countries, rather they have problems with the
USA, and their job is to destroy cities with their missiles to let
them know they have the power to do that.</P>
<P>After San Diego, I flew up to San Francisco (unfortunately, I don't
have the time to travel up the coast slowly).  Here I have checked
out Alcatraz, and was rather saddened to find that most of "The Rock"
was filmed on sets that bear little similarity with the real place.
Oh well.  I plan to check out the other sights before returning
home on Monday.</P>
<P>One thing about the States is the large amount of homeless.  They are
so good at asking for money.  I have only given money on two occasions,
once to the first homeless person I met, and once to a guy who was
so clever that he made me feel genuine guilt and sympathy (ergh).
If I gave a quarter to everyone who asked for it, I would be down
several hundred dollars by now!  I went past one guy with a sign that
said "Please give me money.  I want a beer.  At least I'm honest!".
The guy who swindled me out of my small change did so by coming
up to me, and introducing himself quite politely.  We shook hands.
He told me that his name was Demitrius, and when I told him my name
he expressed delight that we both had Greek names (he started telling
me about Jason and the Argonauts).  We talked for a good ten minutes,
about Australia and New York, where he had come from.  He was quite
knowledgeable, and I was beginning to suspect that he was just a friendly
guy when he told me that he had recently been divorced, and had
subsequently lost his job.  When he showed me his meagre possessions,
and asked with a tear in his eye if I could possibly spare a quarter
so that he could get a burger for dinner, I felt as if it was my
personal quest to help this poor man.  I tell you, he was *good* - he
must have rehearsed that many times before.</P>
<P>It is Halloween here tomorrow, and the ironic thing is that the people
walking around the streets would be a lot *less* scary if they dressed
up as ghouls and demons.</P>
<H2>Back Home</H2>
<P>At the hostel I met a couple of Swedish girls.  Now, I know what the
stereotypical Swedish girl looks like, and I was rather pleased to
discover that one of the girls had typecast herself.  Most of the
guys in the hostel were trying to crack on to her, but not me!  As a
result, the girls tended to hang around with me a lot.  Well, I can't
complain!</P>
<P>Anyway, I am a sucker for punishment so I decided that the best way
to see San Francisco would be to hire a bike and ride around - the
Swedish girls were foolish enough to join me.  I came screaming down
one of those hilly streets at an insane speed, and I consider myself
lucky that I didn't stack the bike (when you are going down a 40 degree
slope, it doesn't take much to tip you over).  We did get to ride across
the Golden Gate Bridge, and through Golden Gate Park, so it turned
out OK.</P>
<P>That evening everyone in the hostel went to the Halloween street party.
I refused to wear fancy dress, as the box of costumes contained mostly
ball gowns, wigs and jewelry.  Well, it was San Francisco after all,
not that there's anything wrong with that.  The street party was wild.
They basically fenced off a huge section of town, and charged you $4
to get in (well, $2 if you were in fancy dress).  You had to go through
a metal detector and weapon search first, of course.  The party consisted
of a lot of spaced out crazy people, food stalls, abundant alcohol, and
live music.  The official estimate of crowd numbers was 250,000.  That's
right - a quarter of a million people.  It's the hugest thing I've ever
been to.</P>
<P>I spent quite a while talking to a tall, slim, beautiful blonde girl
from UCLA.  She was in fancy dress - as an S&M boyscout leader, with
miniskirt, fishnet stockings, high heels, handcuffs and a whip.  Well,
she probably doesn't get out much.  I left the party when she started
whipping me on the bottom.</P>
<P>After Halloween I just lazed around with nothing much to do.  I bought
a few "cultural artifacts" to take home - Junior Mints, Jujy Fruit
and Big Red Gum of course!  On my last day I went to see a restored
version of Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo" at a huge old-fashioned movie
house with a couple of British lasses.  It was a step back in time -
the cinema was packed and the audience really got into the film.  The
movie was set in San Francisco, and it was interesting seeing the sites
as they were 40 years ago.</P>
<P>I am just recovering from the jetlag, and working hard editing 7 hours
of raw video footage down into something that might be mildly
interesting for others to watch.  I will catch up with everyone soon.</P>
