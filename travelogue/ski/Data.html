$comment[]="This is the story of the recent ski trip which I went on with Mark and Adrian.  Just click the navigation buttons at the bottom of the page to flick through the slides.  I apologise for the lack of picture quality, which is due to capturing the pictures from video.  Enjoy!";

$name[]="Mark Eats Brekky";
$comment[]="I arrived in Melbourne a day before Adrian, because I claimed my flight on Frequent Flyers, and therefore could travel in style in Business Class.  Ade was relegated to the red-eye, which I thankfully avoided.  Mark and I met in the city, ate dinner, saw a band and shot some pool with his friends Katelyn and Robby.  The next morning we awoke early, ate brekky, and checked out the road map.  We needed to find where the hell the airport was, as we were going to pick up Adrian.";

$name[]="It's Early!";
$comment[]="When I say we woke up early, I mean <I>early</I>.  Adrian's flight was due to land at 5:05, and it was a 20 minute drive to the airport, so we'd better be leaving!";

$name[]="Airport";
$comment[]="We arrived at the airport to find it enshrouded in thick fog.  Adrian's flight was delayed, and then re-routed to Sydney.  Dammit!  We went back home again, slept for an hour, and then repeated the whole exercise.  Eventually we met Our Man, and began the five hour drive to Falls Creek.";

$name[]="Frying Pan Inn";
$comment[]="We arrived in the late afternoon, settled in, and went out for a practice ski.  As you can see, the weather was pretty good.  This picture was taken from the balcony outside our room.  We stayed at the Frying Pan Inn, the cheapest, most happening place at Falls Creek.  Unfortunately, our room was directly above the pub, which featured live music every night until 2am.  Sleep?  Who needs sleep?";

$name[]="Ade's Irish Jig";
$comment[]="Before having any lessons, the skiing technique employed can be quite original and amusing.  Here Adrian is attempting an Irish Jig, which is unwise while wearing a set of skis.";

$name[]="Snowboarding";
$comment[]="\"Buggrit, I'll try snowboarding instead\", he was heard to remark.  Unfortunately, I didn't get any pictures of Adrian snowboarding, or his impressive (if accidental) somorsaults.  We were all knackered, and decided to get some shut-eye.";

$name[]="Morning Breaks";
$comment[]="The next morning was splendiforous.  We couldn't wait to get out on the slopes.  We saw all kinds of weather during our stay, but I only filmed the good stuff!  Mark was keen to get out there, and woke the rest of us up.";

$comment[]="My God, it's 7 in the morning and I haven't even combed my hair yet!  Put that camera away!";

$name[]="Superman";
$comment[]="Like Superman, I entered the bathroom (which bore a strange resemblance to a telephone box, insofar as dimensions were concerned), and emerged ready for a ski.  We headed downstairs for a cooked breakfast, and then made for the chairlifts.  Let's go!";

$name[]="The Kids Wave";
$comment[]="We caught the chairlift up to the top of the slopes.  People were so friendly.  Even the kids were waving at us.";

$comment[]="\"Stupid kids\", quipped Mark.";

$photo[]="Mark2.jpg";
$name[]="Mark Skiis";
$comment[]="We got to the top, and Mark showed me how it was done.  We decided to attempt the \"Fox Trail\", a narrow track full of jumps which wends it's was between the trees.";

$photo[]="Jason3.jpg";
$name[]="I Follow Mark";
$comment[]="Okay, let's go.  I got up as much speed as I could, and followed Mark.  Eh, was that a bump he just went over?  Let <I>me</I> try that!";

$name[]="Mark Gets Air";
$comment[]="Mark entered the \"Fox Trail\", and attempted to get some air.  Hey, Mark, didn't you tell me that your weight should be forward?  It looks like you're leaning back there, buddy.  You said to never lean back, because then you...";

$name[]="Mark Stacks It";
$comment[]="... crash.  Hey, that was pretty funny!";

$name[]="Mark is Hurt";
$comment[]="I'm glad you agree!  What do you mean, your knee hurts?  Get up, you wuss!";

$photo[]="Jason4.jpg";
$name[]="I Try to Fly";
$comment[]="I couldn't let Mark steal the limelight, so I started getting some airtime too.  My pixie hat flapped around, and I was in serious danger of strangling myself!  Well, okay, that's a lie.  Check out the arm motion there.  I think I thought I could fly.";

$photo[]="Jason6.jpg";
$name[]="The Chair Squat";
$comment[]="The track had all sorts of jumps and drop-offs.  We went through it at insane speeds, like a couple of teenagers.  Fortunately we didn't break anything.  Except a couple of trees which got in the way.  Check out the posture.  It looks like I'm squatting on an invisible chair.  Well, that's what the instructor said to do, so there!";

$photo[]="Jason7.jpg";
$name[]="I Stack It";
$comment[]="Here I am demonstrating how to ski downhill backwards, with your ski's off.  It was a difficult skill to acquire, but I got plenty of practice!  This is much more funny when it's moving.  Imagine me doing the splits, and then a backwards somorsault, and you'll get the idea.";

$photo[]="Jason11.jpg";
$name[]="Stopping Gracefully";
$comment[]="Mark and I eventually reached the bottom of the \"Fox Trail\", and decided to head back to the Frying Pan Inn, and see what the boys were up to.  Here I'm attempting to do one of those slide thingies to stop.  I usually stopped by hitting small children, or roped-off areas.";

$photo[]="Jason13.jpg";
$name[]="Ski Jump";
$comment[]="We went as fast as possible.  Here I am in the classic Ski-Jump position.  What a dork!  Is that a jump I see coming up?";

$name[]="A Little Jump";
$comment[]="Whoahhhh!  I feel sorry for Mark, who's holding the camera!";

$name[]="Dave's Munchies";
$comment[]="We made it back in one piece, to find Dave, the resident pot head, explaining that he'd discovered a cheap way of getting munchies.  He found a broken chocolate vending machine, and emptied it of it's contents.";

$photo[]="Chocs1.jpg";
$name[]="Chocolates!";
$comment[]="As you can see.  These chocolate bars served us well for the remainder of the week.  Mars Bars are great when you're out on the slopes, and get lost, and have to spend the night in the bush.";

$name[]="Chick Magnet ;^)";
$comment[]="I got back, undressed, and prepared to rip a bandage off my leg.  I suffered bad chafing from the ski boots, and needed to put a big sticky bandage on my leg.  Unfortunately I forgot about the pain which would be caused by ripping all of my hairs out.  Check out the tanned chest, ladies, and the impressive pectoral muscles ;^)  Yes, that's sarcasm.  At least I seem to be happy here.";

$name[]="Ski Goggles";
$comment[]="Adrian was keen to show off his Ski-Goggles.  Note the tan line around his eyes in the shape of his sunnies.  This is a classic ski cliche.";

$comment[]="I asked Mark what he though about the trip.  \"Sensational\", was all he'd say.";
