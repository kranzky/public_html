<H1><A HREF="">Jason Hutchens</A>: letter three</H1>

<P>I must begin this, my latest travelogue, with sad news... I haven't
launched my rocket yet.  It's fully assembled and waiting patiently
in my living room on its launching pad, but all launches have been
cancelled at the last minute due to unfavourable weather conditions.
I feel just like NASA.</P>

<P>My last travelogue ended just prior to Chinese New Year, so let me
begin this one from there.  Chinese New Year is celebrated in the
first week of February, and the tradition is that you eat lots of
good food and wear lots of red clothing, red being a lucky colour.
We celebrated CNY in style at Rob, Hooi and Tsung's spacious
apartment, with food provided by Chai, Hooi's visiting brother,
and the highlight being a delicious steamboat, courtesy of Kee-Ju
and Chai-Lin.</P>

<P>I should segue here, because I realise now that I haven't as yet
introduced the cast of characters, which I really should have done
in my very first travelogue.  I'm sure you know who I am, and I
shouldn't need to introduce D., but there are a whole bevy of people
over here who shall remained unmentioned.  Collectively they may be
known as The Unmentionables.  The Usual Gang consists of me, D.,
Cathy, Rob, Hooi, Tsung and Yuri, so, when I fail to mention who
we went to see Madame Butterfly with, for example, you may safely
assume that the Usual Gang was involved.</P>

<P>Anyway, let's get back to more important issues.
What is a steamboat, I hear you ask?  It's basically a Chinese version
of fondue, where you cook your own small portions of fish, chicken,
beef, liver, rice balls and vegetables in a delicious broth which
sits bubbling on the table.  Our hosts put on such a big spread that
we could make nary a dent, and, by the end of the night, quite a lot
of food was left over.  Left-overs are, like Christmas, an integral
part of CNY, except that instead of being left with lots of turkey
and ham, you're left with lots of uncooked meat.</P>

<P>The following day we went to see Blast!, an American marching band
spectacular.  Sounds weird, I know.  Blast! begins with the wonderful
Bolero, played by people toting drums, cymbals and brass instruments,
moving around the stage in formation.  Things take a turn to the
strange after that, although each scene is basically a re-interpretation
of what a marching band could be.  Dancers twirled guns, large blades
of grass, flags, flowers and so forth; they were always twirling something.
The overall highlight was the guys on drums trying to out-do each
other.</P>

<P>Sunday was spent in style at the Dorchester, where we indulged in
high tea, which is an English tradition.  High tea involves dressing
up in your best clothes, then sitting down in a hotel tea room,
sipping the tea of your choice (my favourite is Lapsang Souchong,
also known as "bacon tea" due to its smoky flavour).  Food comes
in three courses; sandwiches first, with the crusts cut off, filled
with things such as cucumber and smoked salmon, followed by freshly
baked scones with a variety of jams and Cornish clotted cream, and
rounded off with a selection of fine pastries.  That evening we saw
Madame Butterfly at the Royal Albert Hall, a spectacular production.</P>

<P>During the week D. and I decided to see Toy Story 2 in Leister Square,
where they have installed a new digital projection theatre (no film
is used at all).  We got the tickets the day before, and happened
upon the premiere of The Beach.  Neither of us was interested in
seeing Leonardo, so we hurried away to have dinner.</P>

<P>On the following Sunday we took a trip to Vinopolis, a wine museum.
It is situated on Southbank, close to Shakespeare's Globe, an old,
thatched roof theatre.  Vinopolis takes you through the history of
wine, and to all of the major wine regions of the world.  There are
various tasting tables set up throughout the place, and we sampled
a lot of interesting wines (and came home with half a dozen bottles).
The highlight was a fantastic Tapas bar which sold 200 wines by the
glass, including $250 bottles of Champagne.  Sensational!</P>

<P>You might remember my friend Robert McLaughlin who is now doing
postdoctorate studies at Oxford?  He's better known as Ram, and he
and his girlfriend met D. and me the following night to see The
Inspector Calls, a fabulous play which follows the fall of an
upper-class household after it's revealed by the mysterious
Inspector Gool that they are all, in some way, implicated in the
recent suicide of a young woman.  Ram managed to get box seats,
one for him and Ruth and one for D. and myself, so we felt quite
posh.  To balance that out, we ate cheap, sensational Vietnamese
food at Cam Phat afterwards (I shall deliberately avoid the
obvious joke about homosexuals here).</P>

<P>D. had been getting progressively more tired with her job in London,
and by Wednesday she suggested that we should go somewhere for
a few days to relax.  We decided on Spain, and left the following
morning.  Barcelona is a beautiful city, and we were treated to
sensational weather for our stay.  We ate in authentic Tapas bars
which we found in dingy alleys, we ate seafood in style at a yacht
club, we sampled Cava, the famous Spanish sparkling wine, and we
(or D., rather) shopped and shopped, coming back with a dozen new
items of clothing.  We spent one night at Montserrat, a benedictine
monastery set in the mountains about one hour by train out of
Barcelona.  If you've ever read The Name of The Rose, you should
be able to picture the monks in the long black robes who would live
in such a place.  We watched them chant in the evening, following
a great hike over the mountain trails, and we ate paela afterwards.</P>

<P>On Wednesday I went to see Woman in Black, a thriller about a man
who has had a terrible experience in the past, and is attempting
catharsis by writing, and then presenting, his story.  The play
is set in an old theatre, which lends a degree of realism.  The
man has come to the theatre in search of somebody to help him
present his story, and the young man whom he finds becomes embroiled
in the tale.  Some of the scenes are performed with no lighting,
save a candle, and they build up a tremendous amount of suspense.
D. was too scared to even attend, and strange sounds emanated from
Cathy during some scenes.</P>

<P>The next few weeks were fairly unremarkable in that we didn't
attend any plays or opera, and we didn't travel in Europe.  We
did, however, dine out, go to art galleries, see movies and so
on.  I shan't bother you with the details!</P>

<P>On the first Monday of this month we went to see Les Miserables,
D.'s favourite musical.  Les Mis has been playing in London
non-stop for fifteen years or so, and I reckon that some of the
performers are getting pretty jaded with it by now.  It was
entertaining, but I reckon Starlight Express had more catchy
tunes, and Madame Butterfly was a more moving story.  Still, you
can't really go past "master of the house", can you?</P>

<P>Two high school friends of D. and Cathy, Elaine and Lucy, visited
London on Friday, and the five of us decided to take the Eurostar
(the train which goes under the Channel Tunnel) to Bruges, a small
city in Belgium.  Bruges is famous for beer, chocolate, waffles,
mussels and lace.  We skipped the lace and sampled the four food
groups, starting with buying many kilograms of chocolate.  We had
a fantastic dinner of lobster and mussels which cost about a third
of what it would have in London.  The highlight was a pub crawl
around the town, where we sampled many of the various Belgian beers,
and returned to the hotel with an extensive array of interesting
Belgian beer glasses which had somehow found their way into our
jacket pockets and backpacks.  It may seem strange to go to Belgium
for one night, but, believe me, you can pack a whole lot of experience
into two days.  We had a ball!</P>

<P>I should tell you about a little hobby of mine which I've developed
since I've moved to London.  Whenever I see a tourist taking a photo,
I try to get into the picture, if I can do so unobtrusively.  I then
smile and wave, the idea being that in ten years time, when they're
sifting through their photo albums, showing their grandchildren what
they did in Europe, they'll spot me in the background.  Silence will
descend as the family stares at the photo in surprise, and this will
finally be broken when someone exclaims, "Hey!  Isn't that Jason
Hutchens?"</P>

<P>Well, that's all we've been doing.  Next week we're off to Israel,
followed by a few places within England before we go to Prague with
Nazy in a months time.  Let me quickly tell you about what I've
been doing at work, and explain exactly why D. and I are off to
Israel.</P>

<P>As you know from my previous travelogue, I have been working at Lionhead
Studios on a computer game called Black&White.  What you may not
know is that the game was recently featured at the announcement of
Microsoft's game console, the X-Box.  For the past few months I have
been sworn to secrecy about the Microsoft deal (we had the Microsoft
big-wigs visit us, show us the X-Box prototype, and request that we
demonstrate the game at the announcement).
The part of
the game I was working on involves the challenges that you will be
faced with while playing the game, and we needed to get a few challenges
ready for the announcement.
It was a lot of fun working
to a deadline under all the secrecy, and observing the reaction of
the public and the press when the announcement was made.</P>

<P>As far as the Israel trip goes, a few weeks ago I was contacted by a
lawyer from Israel on behalf of a wealthy venture capitalist.  The
lawyer flew to London, took me out to lunch, and tried to convince me
to come to Israel to be a part of an artificial intelligence R&D
campus they are establishing.  I have my own plans for my future, so
I declined, but I did tell the lawyer about a few of my ideas in case
his boss wanted to fund their development.  A week later the lawyer
contacted me again, offering to fly both D. and myself to Israel for
four days.  I don't know what to expect, but I've got my fingers
crossed.  We would love to see Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Tel Aviv and
the Dead Sea, so it was an opportunity not to be missed.  And it will
make a change from travelling throughout western Europe.  I'll let
you know what transpired in my next travelogue.</P>

<P>Anyway, my dear friends and family, I feel that it's time to wrap
things up.  I trust you've enjoyed the read, and that this little
letter finds you well.  Bro', could you print this out for the folks
as per usual?  Thanks.  See-you all in June.  Bye!</P>
