$comment[]="The Portrush Hostel.  It cost seven pounds to stay the night.  The place is clean and neat, and is run by a couple.  However the couple have put the place up for sale.  They want to take the year of to travel, you guessed it, to Australia.";

$comment[]="The Causeway.  This was an excellent walk.  On one side we had the spectacular cliffs and the ocean.  The other side was the green rolling Irish hillside.  The two-and-a-half hour or so treck was worth doing.";

$name[]="Giant's Causeway #2";
$comment[]="Giant Causeway.  It's the eighth natural wonder of the world, at least that's how it's advertised.  The geoligists explanation is that it's caused by volcanic eruptions and cooling lava.  However, I read a more romantic version of how the Giant Causeway was formed.  In ancient times there lived a Giant named Finn McCool, he was the commander of the Kind of Ireland's armies.  Like all chaps do, he fell in love with a Lady Giant, who lived on the Staffa Island.  So he built this highway to bring her across.  Ahh...  isn't that sweet?";

$comment[]="I love this picture, it's hilarious.  Yep, we're at the beach and everyone has either a magazine or a book.  You see that blank pit in the middle, that was where I was lying and yep I was reading a magazine too.  This is such a rocky beach.  To get to the water you're better off to put on a pair of shoes.  This is the beach we end up going to because Ciara's car broke down.  Kilarny Beach.  Someone told me that U2 live in this area.  There's some lovely houses along the coast, so I can believe it.";
