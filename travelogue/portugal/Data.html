$comment[]="I visited Lisbon to attend a few conferences.  In addition, D.,
Tsung and Cathy came over from London for the weekend, and we travelled to
Sintra.  I didn't take my camera on that trip, so here you'll just find a few
snaps of the guided tour organised by the conference committee.  Our first
stop was a large cathedral close to the river near Lisbon.";

$name[]="Church Ceiling";
$photo[]="roof1.jpg";
$comment[]="The ceiling of the cathedral was quite interesting.  Actually, a
lot of the buildings in Lisbon have ceilings like this, even small wine
cellars with fairly low ceilings.  Either the Portugese didn't discover you
could build using wooden beams or they have a fanatical sense of aesthetics.";

$name[]="Eery Glow";
$photo[]="glow1.jpg";
$comment[]="At one end of the cathedral a huge circular window let in the
yellow light of the setting sun.  A statue of Christ on the cross was
silhoutted against the window, creating an eery ambience.";

$name[]="Stained Glass";
$photo[]="window1.jpg";
$comment[]="What cathedral would be complete without the obligatory stained
glass windows?";

$name[]="Passageway";
$photo[]="passage1.jpg";
$comment[]="The cathedral featured an outdoor section, with a little garden
and fountain.  The reason why I can't tell you about this in too much detail
is because that's my tour group in the distance, and I was too far away to
hear anything.";

$name[]="Castle";
$photo[]="castle1.jpg";
$comment[]="This fantastic castle is built in the river, not far from the
cathedral.  It was the next stop on the tour, although we could only stay for
ten minutes to take photographs.  The tour ended with an extended tour to a
shopping mall.  Obviously the tour guides got their priorities wrong.";

$name[]="Monument Cross";
$photo[]="cross1.jpg";
$comment[]="The Portugese were tremendously successfull explorers, and a huge
monument on the foreshore, not far from the castle in the previous slide, was
built in their memory.  If you stand at the foot of the monument and look up,
you see this massive sword of Damocles pointing right down at you.  Hope
that's not too ominous!";

$name[]="Monument Statues";
$photo[]="statue1.jpg";
$comment[]="Here are some of the famous Portugese explorers, looking
suitably farsighted, and wielding small toy boats and other exploratory
equipment.  And that brings our slide show to an end!";
