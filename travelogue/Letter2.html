<H1><A HREF="/">Jason Hutchens</A>: letter two</H1>
<P>So many things have happened since the last time I wrote, so expect a long
letter.  You might want to go and make yourself a cup of tea before you
start!  Sitting comfortably?  Well, here we go!</P>

<P>I last spoke to you in early January, just before I was due to start work.
It's now been a month, and I must say that the work has been absolutely
sensational.  In case you haven't heard, I'm working at Lionhead Studios
on a computer game called Black&White.  If you have access to the Web, you
might want to go to www.lionhead.com, where you can find out more about
the game.  If you don't, I'll try to give you a quick summary.</P>

<P>In Black&White you play a God, and you inhabit a beautiful world, complete
with oceans, resplendant mountains, rivers, trees and so forth.  At the
beginning of the game, however, you are not a very influential God, as without
belief a God has no power, and you have no one to worship you.  And so it
begins.  You first task is to increase your power by making people believe
in you, and you can do that by good or evil means (hence the name of the game).
Provide starving villagers with food or strike them down with lightening, it's
your choice.  Once you start going down the path of good or evil, though,
you'll find the environment changing to suit your temperment.  Your hand
will change in appearance too.</P>

<P>That's one thing I haven't mentioned yet; your hand.  Your hand is in fact
the only means by which you can control the game.  You move around the world
by placing your hand on the ground and pulling it toward you; it's that simple.
You can pick up objects (rocks, trees, villagers, cows) and drop them again,
or throw them into the sea, or whatever you like.  You cast spells by waving
your hand in a particular pattern.  It's lots of fun!</P>

<P>If you're one of my grandparents and you're reading a copy of this letter
which has been printed out by my brother and passed from family to family,
you might like to note that I'm not talking about your real hand, but an
artificial hand, which you actually control with the mouse.  It's the
mouse which you control with your real hand.  See, Nanna, I told you
computers were simple!</P>

<P>Once you reach a certain level of power, you can cast a special spell on
any animal in the world, and turn it into your creature.  The creature will
learn by observing the things you do, and effectively becomes a personification
of you in the world.  You can reinforce good behaviour by patting it, and
inhibit bad behaviour by slapping it around.  The creature will fight with,
or make friends with, other creatures it meets (in the multiplayer or online
versions of the game).  You can even teach it to dance the music you play!</P>

<P>My work at Lionhead is divided between writing a "challenge" mechanism for
the game, giving the player a number of tasks to complete, and implementing
the part of the game which will enable your creature to learn to talk based
upon what you say to it.</P>

<P>My days generally run as follows.  I catch the tube to Waterloo station,
riding with D. for some of the way.  Once at Waterloo, I get myself a
bagel and a double espresso for brekky, and catch a train down to Guildford.
The train ride lasts for about thirty minutes, giving me time to read
(Tommo&Hawk and Catch-22 have been knocked off this way) or to work on the
laptop which Amristar kindly lent me (hence the extra long email).  Once
in Guildford it's a twenty minute walk to the office if the weather's fine,
or a bus ride if it isn't.  The weather usually is fine, but extremely cold
at the same time, with ice a common theme.  I then sit at a computer and tap
the keys, occasionally getting out of my chair to put liquid into my body or
let liquid out of my body, until about 6:15, at which time I reverse the
process (the train thing, not  the liquid thing), meeting D. at Pimlico
station, and walking home with her.  We get home at about 8:00.</P>

<P>Anyway, enough of my job.  Let me now tell you about all of the things
D. and I have been doing since my last letter, beginning with our trip to
Amsterdam.  Lisa, our landlady, works in Amsterdam, and has an apartment
in the heart of town, which she vacates on weekends when she returns to
England to go sailing.  She offered us the place, and we jumped at the
chance to have free accomodation.</P>

<IMG SRC="image/travel/amsterdam/canal1.jpg">

<P>The problem with Amsterdam is that it is well known for two things.  And,
no, I'm not referring to clogs and windmills.  Anyone who has watched Pulp
Fiction will know what I mean---drugs and prostitution.  I can tell you that
it's not even worth trying to convince your work colleagues that your
intentions are pure... tell them you're off to Amsterdam for the weekend
and forever they'll assume you're that "sex-crazed, drug addicted Aussie".</P>

<P>Segue time methinks.  I'm the only Australian in the office, and very few
of the guys have been to Australia at all.  I don't consider myself to be
too ocker, and my accent is pretty subtle, but I do find myself constantly
saying things which they find highly amusing.  You're average Brit, for
example, has no idea what the phrase "I've got to bail" means, and "same
diff" is Greek to them.  I find myself saying "g'day" whenever I'm introduced
to someone, and I didn't think I normally said "g'day" that often.  I think
I'm trying to be _more_ Australian than usual, for some reason.  The worst
thing that could possibly happen happened just the other day.  I was working
with Jonty (the Brits shorten Jonathon for Jonty for some reason), and we
were about to perform some test or other, when nature called and I let him
know that "I've just gotta go to the dunny." "Hey everybody", yelled Jonty.
"Jason's just got to go to the dunny!  The dunny!  He's off to the dunny!"</P>

<IMG SRC="image/travel/amsterdam/porn1.jpg" ID="RightImg">

<P>Anyway, back to Amsterdam.  Actually getting into the country in the first
place was quite tough, as poor D.'s passport apparently looks like a poorly
forged document, and she was detained for quite some time by a whole regiment
of Dutch airport police.  We did eventually make it through, and caught a
taxi to our apartment.  The first thing that strikes you about Amsterdam is
that it's a very pituresque city.  Canals run through the city, with narrow
roads on either side of them, with bridges spanning the gap between.  Most
people ride bicycles around, with the result that just wandering around the
streets is an extremely pleasant way to spend a few hours.</P>

<P>Apparently the reason why bicycle riding is so prevalent in Amsterdam is
due to the fact that the city introduced the concept of free bikes for all,
whereby thousands of bikes are made available to the public, and the general
idea is that you ride a bike from A to B where you dump it for someone else
to use.  The scheme backfired when people decided that _any_ bike was free
for the taking, even if it happened to be securely chained up and locked.
The net result is that thousands of crappy bikes are now chained and locked
everywhere, and bicycle theft is an incredibly common occurrence.</P>

<P>Amsterdam is home of the Vincent van Gogh museum, which has some huge number
of his paintings, sketches, letters and severed body parts.  It's great
getting a chance to see so many of his paintings.  They had one of the
sunflowers there.  The highlight for me though was the paintings by Monet,
whom I consider to be an altogether better impressionist, especially if
you're talking landscapes and gardens.  But I'm just a pleb, so what would I
know?</P>

<P>Let's get to the seedy side of Amsterdam, beginning at the flower market,
which sold lots of marijuana seeds and home growing kits.  It's weird to
see such things at flower markets, especially when the clientele consists
mostly of little old ladies and tourists who haven't managed to find the
drug dealers and prostitutes yet.  Newsagents stock all sorts of
drug-related merchandise, and pornographic postcards as well.  I was sorely
tempted to post some of the latter back home, but I fear that Australia Post
would have launched an investigation against my parents, so I chose one of
the canals instead.</P>

<P>Coffee shops line the streets of Amsterdam, and it is in these that you can
go if you'd like to sample some of the green stuff.  I won't try to convince
you that we didn't actually do this... make up your own mind.  Generally you
can get all sorts of cakes and cookies which contain a bit of leaf, and
there's the odd coffee shop which goes a step further, such as the one which
sold fine boxes of chocolates laced with the drug.  Actually getting a coffee
is a bit more difficult, and getting a beer is impossible, as it's actually
against the law for the coffee shops to sell both marijuana and beer.  I
guess the two mustn't mix too well...</P>

<P>Speaking of chocolates, we found a sensational chocolate shop which sold the
most delicious nougat I've ever eaten.  A box of twelve nougat squares cost
about a dollar, and we bought four boxes.  They didn't last nearly long enough.</P>

<P>One night we decided to bite the bullet and visit the red light district, as
all of the tourists do.  When I say "we" I refer to our group of four...
Cathy and Vincent and D. and me.  The first thing you notice about the red
light district is that the stores which sell adult merchandise openly flaunt
the fact, and display their wares in rather garish window displays.  No need
to dash inside to see what all the fuss is about at all.  At first I thought
we'd taken a wrong turning and ended up in a street of  German butchers,
but a closer inspection revealed that the fine sausages hanging in the window
weren't meant to be eaten.</P>

<P>As another example of the prevalence of drugs in Amsterdam, we walked past
street vendors who loudly announced what they were selling to all passers by.
"Cocaine!  Ecstasy!  Cocaine!  Ecstacy!"  Quite bizarre.</P>

<P>Eventually we found the main drag, and were amused to see that the prostitutes
actually rent out small rooms, and stand behind the front windows, doing
their utmost to attract business.  I don't think I've seen a crowd of men
enjoying window shopping as much!  Although the red light district is quite
seedy, it's touristy enough to be safe and interesting, although there
weren't too many women around who weren't there to make a buck.</P>

<P>Before this letter degenerates into a sordid tale of sleaze, allow me to
segue and save us all the embarrassment.  D. and I were both working the
week we returned from Amsterdam, and have been ever since, so not much
happened from Monday to Friday.  We went out to dinner three times, visited
a pub on Friday night, and watched Fantasia 2000, a Disney animation, at
one of the IMAX cinemas over here.  I can heartily recommend this movie;
it's absolutely sensational.  The basic premise is that pieces of animation
are set to classical music, and it is done incredibly well.  The cartoon
set in New York to Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" is just fantastic.  See
it if you get the chance.</P>

<P>The following weekend saw Ram come and stay with us.  Ram is a Uni chum
of mine, and is doing post-doc biomedical research in Oxford.  A group
of us went to Viet Hoa on Saturday night for dinner (I can't keep D. away
from that place; refer to my previous letter if you don't know what I'm
talking about).  The next day we walked around the streets of London,
and returned home for afternoon tea with the gang.  This involved me making
mum's world-famous scones, and they went down a treat.  Although I made
whipped cream (and later whipped it some more, finding out about curds and
whey in the process), everyone seemed to prefer clotted cream, which I'd
never seen before, and which is basically of the same consistency as butter,
with the exception that it's white and tastes like cream.</P>

<P>The following week we went to see Art, a play which is basically about
how the friendship between three middle-aged men degenerates when one of
them purchases an abstract painting.  The play is dialogue driven; there
is no fancy theatrics or sets to speak of, and it is in this that it excels.
The highlight is when the weedier of the characters bursts into the room,
having escaped from a night of hell at home with his fiancee, his mother
and his mother-in-law to be arguing about the wedding arrangements, and
delivers a monolugue which lasts for about ten minutes, during which time
he takes nary a breath and slowly goes from anger to fatigue, passing
through numerous other emotions on the way.</P>

<P>The following weekend was my birthday.  Thank-you to everyone who wished
me well, by the way, it was much appreciated!  And a pox on those who didn't!
D. got me a rocket for my birthday!  In the toy stores over here they
actually sell rocket kits.  Mine is a metre tall, and is able to climb to
an altitude of 800 feet, which is rougly 250 metres, before descending to
earth on a parachute.  I've got 24 engines, which are basically explosive
charges, and a Star Wars electronic launching pad.  Unfortunately I haven't
had a chance to try it yet, but you'll be the first to know when I do... just
keep your eyes on the international section of the West Australian!</P>

<P>D.  and I went to a fantastic Tapas bar for dinner on the night of my
birthday, and had the downstairs restaurant to ourselves for most of the
meal.  Tapas is the Spanish equivalent of Antipasto; we had about seven
dishes ranging from sausages stewed in red wine and marinated garlic
mushrooms to lamb cutlets and a seafood platter, with plenty of bread and
olives, and two bottles of amontillado Sherry.  After dinner we caught
"Three Seasons", a Vietnamese movie featuring Harvey Kietel.  D. was able
to understand everything, of course, but I made do with the sub-titles, as,
apart from "Hello", "Thank-you" and "I'm hungry, please feed me", my
Vietnamese is abysmal.  I reckon those three phrases are pretty much all I
need to know, though!</P>

<P>On Sunday we visited the Cambden markets, where we bought a cribbage set for
three people, which we still haven't played.  Before the markets we made
pancakes for brekky, and D. proved herself to be an expert flipper, coaxing
the pancake to perform the most amazing spins, flips and twirls before landing
back in the frypan.  I think skillful people should be more humble, and just
get down to the nitty gritty of cooking us poor unskilled layabouts our
breakfast instead of flaunting their talents so unashamedly.  They'd get
more food cooked more quickly that way for a start.  On an unrelated note,
I have noticed a circular wet patch on the kitchen ceiling which I'm getting
slightly suspicious about...</P>

<P>We returned from the markets in time to cook a roast chicken for Sunday
dinner.  I'd never cooked a roast before, and by the time I'd finished
with the chicken it was well and truly stuffed.  A bottle of fine wine
came to the rescue; all food is better with a glass of wine, and we ate
our roast chicken with pride.  The carcass made a sensational stock for
canh chua, a Vietnamese hot and sour soup, which D. promised to cook during
the week, and never did.</P>

<P>Australia Day passed without a hiccough for me, while the rest of the gang
sang Aussie songs in a pub, and persistently phoned me up to sing them at
me and have unintelligible conversations, for I was at home polishing up my
entry to the Loebner Contest, which I enter every year.  I spent days and
days polishing my entry, and the stupid contest organisers never ended up
using it, for reasons unknown to me.  To say I was extremely pissed off would
be an understatement, and I had to vent my rage by behaving normally and not
saying anything, which is my usual outlet when I'm angry or stressed.</P>

<IMG SRC="image/travel/oxford/rob1.jpg">

<P>We saw Starlight Express the next day.  I nearly didn't make it to the show
on time, having to run from train to tube to tube to theatre only to arrive
as the doors were about to be closed.  Starlight Express is an Andrew Lloyd
Webber musical about toy trains which a young boy is playing with, and the
trains are played by people on roller skates.  The set is massive, with the
performers skating all over the place, several stories high at times.  Think
of a cross between Rollerball, Thomas the Tank Engine and Cats.  Then question
the sanity of Andrew Lloyd Webber.  With such touching songs as "Freight
is Great" how can you go wrong?  Seriously, it was a great experience, and
we're still singing the songs ten days later.</P>

<IMG SRC="image/travel/oxford/dzung1.jpg" ID="RightImg">

<P>On the weekend the entire gang of us caught a bus to Oxford, and we spent
the day looking around the various colleges there.  We lunched in the very
pub where C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkein and Lewis Carrol used to meet to read
their stories to one another, although I daresay the atmosphere was a bit
more conducive to reading books in the old days.  After lunch we browsed
around one of the extremely massive bookshops in Oxford before going to 
evensong at one of the chapels to see a choir sing, and then repairing to
a lively pub where we tasted the local ales, ate lamb pies and watched
Oxford students in tweed suits and enormous fake comedic breasts drink half
a nip of whisky and before being violently ill in the rubbish bins outside.</P>

<P>D. and I visited the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square the following day,
where we saw yet more art.  We started off in the 1500's, and were disappointed 
to find that people hadn't learned to paint landscapes yet, with even
full-length portraits being a rarity.  We hurried to more modern hallways,
and enjoyed a variety of paintings by lots of famous arty farty types.  I
was particularly enamoured with small, detailed paintings of towns and
buildings in provincial Italy by some bloke whose name I forget.</P>
