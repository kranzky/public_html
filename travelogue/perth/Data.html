$comment[]="That's D. and me in London just prior to our trip back to Perth.  As you can see it's pretty cold, but our spirits were high and we were looking forward to visiting home for a few weeks.  D. had also just bought me a pasta making machine, and I was justifiably proud of my first tagliatelli attempt.  Jamie Oliver, eat your heart out!";

$comment[]="Our London apartment is in that big red brick building behind me, on the corner, on the fourth floor.  So our kitchen window is the one up the top, just behind the closest tree.  The pasta machine is just inside there.  You can't see it in the photo, so you'll have to trust me on that.";

$name[]="Perth";
$photo[]="perth1.jpg";
$comment[]="And that's the skyline of Perth, overlooking the Swan River.  That's right, <I>river</I>.  People fish in it, go prawning in it, swim in it, windsurf on it, and generally <I>don't</I> die in it from toxic shock.  You also cannot jump over it without getting wet.  Perth has the most restaurants, the most millionaires and probably the happiest people per capita than anywhere else in the world.  It's also the most isolated city in the world, and we'd all like it to stay that way!";

$comment[]="Here's some evidence of the general cleanliness of the Swan: this is Lily, my seven-year-old niece, quite happily swimming in the river and totally failing to get poisoned.";

$name[]="Dog";
$photo[]="dog1.jpg";
$comment[]="And that's me playing catch with my brother's dog.  Lily is still swimming in the river behind me, but you can't see her in this photo.  The dog isn't jumping for a ball, by the way.  We've trained her to walk on two legs like a human, and she throws the ball with her paws.";

$name[]="Darren";
$photo[]="daz.jpg";
$comment[]="This is Darren, one of my brothers and the dad of Lily.  He lives down south in Albany, an old whaling town.  Although he looks like a crocodile hunter he's actually a graphic artist.  He only harpoons whales in his leisure time.";

$name[]="Picnic";
$photo[]="picnic.jpg";
$comment[]="D. and I were having a picnic with Darren, Ilsa, Lily and the dog.  We drove towards the river and found this nice spot.  It's not really a picnic area, just a shady spot between the river and the road.  We were the only people there.  In this photo D. is looking up at Lily climbing a tree.";

$name[]="Tree Climb";
$photo[]="treeclimb.jpg";
$comment[]="And there she is, with her proud dad looking up at her from below.  He seemed a bit agitated at the time, if I remember rightly.  Lily must get her climbing skills from her dad.  I remember when we were kids he was always the first one up the tree.  My mum and dad really thought he was great.";

$name[]="Footy";
$photo[]="footy.jpg";
$comment[]="After our picnic lunch we drove a bit further around the river to Point Walter, where we met up with my other brother, Brendan.  Here you can see Brendan and Darren playing kick-to-kick with an Australian footy.";

$name[]="Frisbee";
$photo[]="frisbee.jpg";
$comment[]="While the boys were kicking the footy, D. and Lily played with a frisbee which they'd stolen from a nearby family when they weren't watching.  Note the massive grassed area in the background, and remember that this is a typically perfect sunny weekend afternoon.  If you think it's weird that the place isn't packed to the brim you've got to realise that Point Walter is but one of dozens and dozens of nice family places to go to.";

$name[]="Parents";
$photo[]="parents.jpg";
$comment[]="My parents joined our little gathering a bit later on, and we went for a walk along the river.  Here my dad (Glen) is pointing out a boat shed on the opposite shore where he hired a boat and rowed my mum (Barbara) along the river at twilight when they were courting.  They don't do anything so romantic these days!.";

$name[]="Viet Hoa";

$comment[]="The next day D. and I ate lunch at her family's restaurant, Viet Hoa, before driving into the hills to do a bit of bushwalking.";

$name[]="Serpentine Dam";
$photo[]="serpentine1.jpg";
$comment[]="We started off at Serpentine Dam.  Eerie to drive 45 minutes out of the city and find yourself in the hills without another soul in site.  As you drive into the hills the landscape changes, and you pass many historical sites, such as a large open field in which, over one thousand years ago, a mighty battle was not fought.  Or the small hill on top of which an extremely significant religious event utterly failed to happen.  Or the small stretch of land which has absolutely no importance to anyone.  So many Australians completely fail to protest violently, and seem to revel in enjoying their multicultural society peacefully.  Weird.";

$name[]="Walkabout";
$photo[]="walkabout.jpg";
$comment[]="We decided to move on to the nearby Pipehead Dam instead.  D. found herself a sturdy walking stick and we explored the bush.  Once again, there was absolutely nobody around.  After all our travelling it seemed strange to be able to come to such a lovely spot and not be bothered by hundreds of other people.  Australia is such a big place, though: Western Australia, the state of which Perth is the capital city, is four times the size of Texas (over one million square miles).  The whole country, however, has only 8% of the population of the USA.  So I guess Australia is kinda like an America where 92% of the people have mysteriously gone missing.";

$name[]="Kookaburra";
$photo[]="kookaburra.jpg";
$comment[]="We saw this kookaburra sitting on the fence as we were walking across the dam.  Kookaburras are a kind of kingfisher.  You can feed them sausages from the barbie and they'll kill them as if the snagger was a dugite, and then they'll fly to the top of a gum tree and laugh at you.";

$name[]="Reflection";
$photo[]="reflection.jpg";
$comment[]="We ended up chilling out beside a babbling brook, enjoying the sunshine and the peace.  Perth really is a beautiful spot.  My only regret is that I tended not to use the video camera.  It's such a chore to get it out when you're enjoying yourself.  Oh well, perhaps I'll take more footage on our next trip home!";
