$comment[]="Not a very nice place.  It's Kilmainham Prison, very depressing inside.  Nazy, Noel and myself went on a tour inside.  What's that movie called?  ... \"Michael Collins\" was filmed here.  It's quite a political prison, political prisoners were held here, some were hanged here too.";

$comment[]="Very nice B/B.  For 20 pounds ($40) I had my own room with my own shower, a TV in the room, breakfast and they make your bed every morning.  This is where I stayed in Galway.  I went here for an interview and stayed for 3 days.  Galway is well known for their oysters.  I had oysters for dinner 2 days in a row.  Linh, you would love it here.";

$comment[]="This is the day I went on the tour in Galway.  Irish countrysides are so green.  I'm at an old monastry (1200?), anyway it's very very old and I love it.  Don't you wish you were here?";

$comment[]="Our second stop was the burrens.  The hillside from as far as the eyes can see is covered with limestone.  The monument you see behind me is an ancient place of worship or burial.";

$comment[]="Burrens.  An Italian guy took this picture for me.  He and his girlfriend were on the same tour as me.  they're in Ireland to study English.  If you walk in Dublin you'll see quite a lot of Spanish, Italian and French who come over for the summer to study English.  Anyway they were really nice.  The guy asked me if I knew any Australians who would like to live with him in Italy... he really wants to learn English.";

$name[]="The Cliffs of Moher #1";
$comment[]="Cliffs of Moher.  It may not look it in this photo, but it's a sheer drop from where I am lying.  This is my favourite place out of the tour.  You'll see lots of photos I've taken, but the photo cannot replace the sensation of being here.  It takes my breath away, I'll definately come back when Cathy comes over.  Apparently 10 people fall to their death each year.  Mainly tourists leaning too far over to take a photo.  Well, that's what the bus driver reckons.";

$comment[]="One of the best weekends Ireland has every had.  A 25 degree day may be no big deal for Aussies, but when the weather is like this it is such a big deal that people take the afternoon off to go to the beach.  There's Aphra, Louisa, Avril and Stephen, and they took the Friday off to go to the beach.  We had a lovely picnic at the beach.  Who said Ireland weather is miserable?!?  From what I hear, people turned up at work on Monday red and peeling.";
